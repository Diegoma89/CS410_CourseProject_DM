B0863D4XJW,Gandalf,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect,"Reviewed in the United States on March 28, 2020","In my opinion, the 2020 MacBook Air is a perfect laptop. It has physical keys that are a pleasure to type on, a beautiful screen, an optimal size, good pricing, and a quad-core processor. The only ""touch"" button is the fingerprint sensor and the touch pad. The onboard graphics are as good as discrete graphics from a few years ago according to benchmarks, which is impressive. The speakers work well. Being an educator, I purchased it on the Apple Education Store for $1200, and it couldn't have come at a better time, given the transition to Zoom in the coronavirus pandemic. Thank you, Apple, for rediscovering yourself. I had been holding onto my 2012 MacBook Pro because I was unimpressed with the offerings the past few years.You shouldn't get this if you are looking for onboard power, but if you are, you probably didn't need me to tell you that. Otherwise, get it. It's great.Update: After reviewing benchmarks and reviews, I believe the upgrades you should consider, in order of priority are:1. i3 -> i52. 8gb -> 16gbThe i5 -> i7 is a small boost in power per Geekbench scores, but again, this isn't supposed to be used for heavy computing due to cooling limitations, so this is a novelty in my opinion. Additionally, the storage upgrades (up to 2 TB) are hard to justify when you have EXTREMELY FAST 40 GBP/s thunderbolt 3 ports that can easily be used for an external SSD that is more or less as fast as the built-in SSD. Unlike the other upgrades, which are set in stone once you purchase the computer, the memory can be increased with external hard drives with little to no compromise. This upgrade is a novelty as well, in my opinion.Update 2: The computer works well in most situations. Because of some laggy moments while running a lot of programs, I will be returning the default configuration I ordered and getting a customized i5 or i7 and 16gb ram. During Zoom screen sharing (and while many other programs run), sometimes the fan will whir (it's supposed to), but I installed a CPU temperature app and it appears to regulate temperature successfully. I haven't tempered my praise for this machine, because it's not supposed to be a performance workhorse."
B0863D4XJW,Rosella Serinelli,2.0 out of 5 stars,Camera has very bad performances,"Reviewed in the United States on April 1, 2020","It has been widely reported that the camera on the 2020 MacBook Air is low quality, but mine was definitely in the non-acceptable range. Picture was very grainy, unfocused, and low light level. I strongly suspect the glass in front of the video chip was damaged, perhaps for a contamination during assembly, but have now way of checking directly. Cleaning the outside had no effect.With heavy heart, I decided to return the unit, and buy an equivalent from the big-box store, where quality can (and will) be checked before purchasing.Update: refund for the item still pending, 14 working days after the returned item was delivered to Amazon. Worse than expected and worse than advertised (14 calendar days)"
B0863D4XJW,Sanjeev,5.0 out of 5 stars,Better than Last Year's and Original MacBook Air,"Reviewed in the United States on March 29, 2020","The original MacBook Air is retailing for like $749.99 right now. Don't buy that. It looks ugly and it's old. Buy the new refreshed 2020 model. This model is authentic, straight from Apple, and it looks fresh.One downside: Open it in a garage or something. I opened it in my room and my room smells like aluminum. Overall, this is a really good product for day-to-day use."

B0863D4XJW,Orangeman,4.0 out of 5 stars,Nice Computer at an Affordable Price,"Reviewed in the United States on April 1, 2020","For the average or small business person this computer will do more than enough and is a vast improvement over previous models. Catalina OS though sucks, otherwise would have given it a 5 rating. Problem is a lot of software I need for work is limited or won't work with Catalina. Yeah, you can take a chance and transition back to High Sierra or whatever but that's not a task I would want to handle myself personally and in checking with several computer guys in the area its not worth the cost, puts the price right back up to where the MacBook Airs were priced before. Keyboard is heaven, processor is fast enough for the most part, other than Catalina its great. Apple, get your act together, Catalina is not what most people want or need in my opinion."
B0863D4XJW,Delvin Douchebaggery,5.0 out of 5 stars,SUPER ULTRA MEGA AWESOMETOSH,"Reviewed in the United States on March 31, 2020","What an upgrade over the 2017 Macbook air! Retina, magic keyboard, speakers, smaller form factor, finger print something-or-other, etc. When you hold it in your hand(s) it feel like a solid pice of aluminum. Totally pimptastic to the max. Getcha some!"
B0863D4XJW,Ash,1.0 out of 5 stars,Loud fan during FaceTime calls and poor camera,"Reviewed in the United States on May 18, 2020","The camera has a poor image quality (only 720p) and the fan gets very loud during FaceTime/Zoom calls. The MacBook Air 2020, like the MacBook Air 2018 and 2019, has very poor thermal design because there is no pipe to connect the fan to the CPU's heatsink.The MacBook Air 2020 is suitable for causal use. But even a video call will push the CPU's temperature to a 100 degrees celsius. Because of the poor thermal design, the fan becomes loud and the device will thermal throttle (meaning it limits the CPU's speed in order to reduce its temperature). This was not a present problem in MacBook Air devices produced before 2018 as the CPUs in those devices were properly cooled (the fan was connected to the CPU with a pipe).With the 2020 MacBook Air, you get a loud fan and a CPU performance that cannot be sustained for a longer time. The problem becomes even worse when you connect an external monitor to it.The most important advantage that the MacBook Air 2020 has over other Apple laptops is that it is the only one which still has a keyboard with no Touch Bar. So many people dislike the gimmicky Touch Bar in the MacBook Pro, as the Touch Bar ends up getting in your way and slowing you down.This would be a great laptop if it has a proper thermal cooling system and a better camera (at least a 7-megapixel sensor capable of 1080p)."

B0863D4XJW,Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Do NOT buy this computer from Amazon!,"Reviewed in the United States on May 1, 2020","Amazon does not check this product for manufacturing defects. When my computer arrived the screen has bubbles in it and they are very large ones. For the price of this computer it should be defect free! When I tried to contact Amazon Customer service I get this ""Currently Unavailable."" I am stuck with this expensive computer and it's defects. I cannot return it because I need it for my business. I wanted Amazon to replace it but That option is ""Currently Unavailable"" too. The camera on this computer is grainy and low quality. I'm not sure if that is a defect too or if that is  just the quality of the camera. If you buy this item through Apple they will make sure the product is free from defects although it will cost a bit more. You have to decide that for yourself. I am very disappointed with this product and Amazon for not giving me the support I needed with this product."
B0863D4XJW,Cliente de Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Maybe used.,"Reviewed in the United States on May 25, 2020","I suspect the MacBook Air I received was used. The computer could not found the hard drive, when I tried to use the recovery option, surprise, the computer was locked, possibly by the previous owner. It had fingerprints in the screen and the keyboard. I'm very dissapointed with Anazon, it's the first time I bought a NEW Macbook and instead received something that looks like being used, unusable and locked. Returned immediately."
B0863D4XJW,aisia beamon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome purchase,"Reviewed in the United States on May 7, 2020",I am in love best investment that I have made.  I have been working from home and taking online classes.  Makes it so convent and easy.  Love the sound and feel of the keyboard. Webcam sucks but that’s not why I got it.
B0863D4XJW,Essence W.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Slow - Do Not Buy,"Reviewed in the United States on April 6, 2020",This MacBook Air is extremely slow. Right out the box it was slow and even after updating it is still slow and seems to only be getting slower day by day. Returning. Avoid this rip-ff at all cost.
B0863D4XJW,MC,1.0 out of 5 stars,Please don’t purchase. You’ll be disappointed,"Reviewed in the United States on May 18, 2020","I’m extremely disappointed. As soon as I turned it on the fan was on super loud, it was slow and when I started time machine to begin a new backup it took forever. It was brand new out of the box and it sadly sucks. I’m returning after having it for a day. I had my IT family member  take a look and they could no believe how slow it was. It rebooted on its own twice within the first hour of using it. I’m sadly returning it. I need a computer but this ain’t worth it. Save yourself and find something else. I’m a huge Apple fan but this really is awful."
B0863D4XJW,Chris,1.0 out of 5 stars,DID NOT WORK,"Reviewed in the United States on April 26, 2020","The laptop came in really good packaging and was really nice out of the box. But when I was starting everything up, the screen automatically went black and the fans turned on at a very high level. I called the apple support line but their methods of trying to restart the computer did not work. Very upset on how this turned out!"
B0863D4XJW,J. T. ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Laptop if you Pony Up for the Quad Core Processor,"Reviewed in the United States on April 26, 2020","I first bought the lowest-priced MacBook Air which has the lowest capacity SSD of all available. When it showed up at my house, I was surprised at how sluggish it was. I read some reviews, and realized that Apple didn't make it clear (at least to me) that the lowest-priced Air also has a slower, dual core processor. It makes sense in hindsight, but I digress. I returned that Air, and replaced it with the 500+GB SSD and quad core processor. Wow! The difference in performance is marked! Multitasking, turning on from sleep, everything is MUCH quicker and smoother than with the dual core processor. If you can afford the higher-priced model, I really recommend it!Overall, the MacBook Air is really a beautiful machine aesthetically. I the recycled aluminum exterior is slick and high-end. The onboard speaker won't ever be confused for an external sound system, but it is the best onboard speaker system I've heard. The Retina screen looks great; vibrant and detailed. I also love the large touch pad with the gestures.My favorite aspect of the laptop is the OS. Out of the box this runs Catalina. I haven't owned a Mac since the iBook G4, but I got back into it without much exploring required. I like how easily it works with my iPhone XR as well. Getting texts on the laptop, or pushing a webpage on my iPhone to my Air is seamless and easy. Things just work. I needed to download updated drivers so that I could print wirelessly to my Canon laser printer, but that took five minutes. I also downloaded and installed Chrome for Mac, which I use for a few things, but Safari works very well for the sites I visit. I did have to buy a converter cable that switched from the onboard USB-C to a regular USB cable for a few attachments I have, but that was pretty cheap (especially for an Apple product). I wish the Air had one more USB-C port.Some people hate the onboard camera. At first I was disappointed with it too. With all of this COVID business, I use my laptop to play D&D online with friends via Roll20. We use cameras to interact with each other, and although I found the onboard camera to be slightly grainy, it is very fluid. One of my friends commented that everyone else's video feed stuttered as they moved, but mine looked like he was watching TV. So, although it could be better, it is NOT horrible for my purposes. For the price we pay, Apple could beef up the camera, but it is what it is."
B0863D4XJW,Madeline Shirey,5.0 out of 5 stars,Absolutely fantastic purchase. Lightning fast shipping. Couldn't be happier.,"Reviewed in the United States on April 8, 2020","So, between apples new keyboard, and with the government c19 rebate coming, I figured it was time I got a new laptop. I couldn't be happier with it. The machine itself is lighting fast, and the keyboard is just a hair short of orgasmic. The new key switches add the perfect amount of weight to the keys that frankly make it exhilarating to type on. The battery life has been pretty much as advertised, as expected with . No complaints there. My only gripe, if I have one, is the camera on it is kind of garbage. I mean it's functional, and after this pandemic thing is over Ill likely never use it again, so its a small gripe. But still. As far as shipping goes, Amazon didn't fail to deliver. Initially I planned to just buy it from Apple directly, but they were talking about 3 weeks out before it would ship. Checked over here, and, though I couldn't get the upgraded ram chip I wanted, I got the computer in 3 days during a pandemic. Actually two days before it was promised. Well done, Amazon. Another smile delivered."
B0863D4XJW,Matt,4.0 out of 5 stars,It’s a bang for the buck! ...Almost (see edits),"Reviewed in the United States on April 7, 2020","So far it’s been a killer of a laptop! The keyboard is pretty great and it sounds and feels great to type on. I actually want to write with my laptop now. I got the i3 model, and as it doesn’t sound impressive I think it’s the best option for the MacBook Air as this laptop does have overheating issues (hence the 4/5 stars) and as the i3 doesn’t require as much power as an i5 or i7, it doesn’t have as bad of throttling issues. It remains fast enough for my needs as well, it also has enough storage for my 25GB of music, my entire 20GB of google drive and all my apps, and it runs them all pretty fast, including Adobe Lightroom.TLDR: A fast little laptop with great build and aesthetic, improved keyboard, great speakers (for a laptop), and a lower than average MacBook price. But with overheating issues (wait for the next MacBook Pro if you want to avoid the heat issue). 5-StarsEDIT:I am thinking about getting a return because of the heating issue. If I only have a couple apps open and watch YouTube full screen, my cpu/gpu STILL reach nearly 80degrees. Unacceptable. It’s a great laptop, but that reason alone if such a letdown...Save your money for the next MacBook Pro, or get the 2017 MacBook Air, at least that one has a heat pipe connected to the fan. 2-StarsEDIT 2:Ok, so somehow my worries are going down about the heat thing. No matter what I do with it I haven't really noticed any slowdowns or problems. The fans may ramp up at some point, but even so it still cools down relatively quick, so I feel like it is something that I can tolerate as there's nothing else with the laptop I dislike. 4-Stars"
B0863D4XJW,Benjamin W. Decker,1.0 out of 5 stars,Terrible Camera,"Reviewed in the United States on April 15, 2020",I bought this because of the advertised “HD” camera. The camera is garbage. Super disappointed
B0863D4XJW,Talia Cotton LCS,1.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed,"Reviewed in the United States on April 21, 2020","The computer kept crashing!! It would start up, freeze and restart. I paid too much money for that to happen. I sent it back for a refund. I’m sooooo disappointed!"
B0863D4XJW,Austin Dame,3.0 out of 5 stars,Very Limited Uses,"Reviewed in the United States on June 13, 2020","I'm a computer technician and I'm also an author (ghost writer technically, so nothing is actually published in my name).  As a computer technician I would give this computer a 1/5.  It's a disposable paper bag with a horrible cooling system.  If one minor thing goes wrong with it, it's toast.  Soldered on SSD and RAM, very few modular components, etc.  So why did I buy it?Well, as an author I need a computer with a good keyboard that's lightweight and has a long battery life.  For writing and reading articles online, this computer is great.  If you need to do ANYTHING else however (including watching YouTube videos - which wouldn't be taxing on any other computer), you should choose a different computer.  The cooling system I mentioned?  It's basically non-existent.  The fan isn't connected to the heat sink at all.  This means that if you use the computer for anything taxing at all (YouTube videos, games, photo editing, etc.) it's going to overheat.  This will cause the computer to die in about a year or two, and when it does, the cost for repair is going to be close to $1,000 because of the way Apple designed it.If all you're going to do is browse the internet and type documents then this is an okay computer that should last you 3-5 years.  If you want to do anything else then I recommend a PC.  If you absolutely have to go Mac, then get the MacBook Pro (the new one with the standard keyboard)."
B0863D4XJW,Carolyn,1.0 out of 5 stars,Does not work out of the box,"Reviewed in the United States on April 19, 2020","It boots up, but shuts down and reboots ever five minutes.Brand new out of the box and it will not completely boot up, apple logo shows up on screen then computer shuts down and restarts every few minutes without ever completely booting up. I have returned this item."
B0863D4XJW,Catherine Mae,5.0 out of 5 stars,Absolute powerhouse.,"Reviewed in the United States on April 7, 2020","I’ve used PC since I could remember. I decided to upgrade and I don’t regret it. This laptop is so tiny but an absolute powerhouse of machinery. The speed is impeccable and the overall performance is even better.I can easily run Photoshop, Netflix & Google Chrome with 5+ open tabs and the laptop does NOT heat up or slow down. It stays cool and runs as if the applications weren’t in use at all. I don’t use other apps besides Facebook messenger, which might be the reason why the laptop otherwise has a lot of give.Expensive, but I’m not disappointed. The only CON I can think of is the webcam. Absolute trash. In 2020 there’s no reason why the webcam should be this bad, and for the price we’re paying, we see better quality webcams in PCs today. Apple has no reason not to do better in terms of the camera."
B0863D4XJW,Juana,4.0 out of 5 stars,Very worth getting for price and specs,"Reviewed in the United States on April 6, 2020",The new magic keyboard is amazing when typing. Unlike the 2019 MacBook Air. It’s so amazing how you pay $999 for double the storage you got form last year that’s starts at $1099. It’s is very fast and smooth. The only thing I don’t like is the noisy fan. The reason for this is because the MacBook is trying to run at its full potential for some stuff so from keeping it firm overheating the fan turns on. Besides that you should get it.
B0863D4XJW,JB,2.0 out of 5 stars,Want to feel productive on a daily basis? Avoid the MacBook Air.,"Reviewed in the United States on May 18, 2020","Three weeks in. Mac user since 1994. Badly wishing I purchased another laptop for work.Apple .. not sure what's happened with your products. My last two iPhones have infested with bugginess. Now this MacBook Air.Bought the MacBook Air as a light-weight machine for light work. I am a consultant and this is my work computer. Here's what I use on a daily basis: Two 17W external monitors, a USB external drive, Chrome, Zoom, and Office 365 through web browser.This MacBook Air 2020 cannot handle the above. Can you believe that?If you're in the same boat as me, do not buy this machine. My productivity has tanked. Multiple times a week I have to stop working, pinpoint problem, and hunt and hunt for an easy resolution. Today I am stopping work to write a review. Yet again problems with inadequate resolutions or none at all.Since purchasing 3 weeks ago, I've lost productivity 2-3 times a week (twice I lost over two hours) trying to figure out:1 (and most importantly). Why does the fan run continuously LOUD?Apple resolution: None. Apple doesn't acknowledge the problem let alone a flaw in its design.Researching reviews from other MacBook Air 2020 owners show running Chrome uses up ALL of the MacBook Air's processing power. The processor overheats and on goes the fan. With 5+ tabs open or tabs plus another application open, the fan powers on full force and Chrome often crashes.The MacBook Air owners' resolution? Don't use Chrome. Need or want Chrome? Buy a third party app to decrease processing speed. Need processing speed to work? Umm, well, buy a different computer I guess?I prefer Chrome because clients often use Google products. Chrome's Inspect Element is the best browser tool out there.Interesting part: All of the publication previews and reviews said MacBook Air 2020 could run Chrome with 30 tabs ""without a problem!"" Search the internet for us real MacBook Air 2020 purchasers and users.There are so many other problems in three weeks of use...2. Why bootup is so incredibly slow.Apple resolution: Bootup with a simple 250GB external drive plugged in to a mini dock sucks too much power from Mac. What?3. Why configuring external screens is difficult.Apple resolution: The shell of a Mac positioned directly below a monitor should be kept closed. What?4. Why my mini dock can only power two external monitors (17W consumption per monitor) but not with a simple USB external drive.Apple solution: Buy a separately powered dock.Okay, how much money do I need to spend on buying and trying accessories?In the past a Mac would tell you if an accessory was using too much power. This MacBook Air does not.5. Why after I put the Mac to sleep, the laptop awakes on external screens after I close the shell.Apple resolution: Keep the Mac shell closed always. What?6. Why the dock cannot be locked to one screen.Apple resolution: None.In buying a work laptop, I should have considered all my Apple problems in the last 10-15 years. Should have stuck to my gut and switched to PC."
B0863D4XJW,Social science professor,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Much improved, almost perfect, and yes - the keyboard lives up to the hype!","Reviewed in the United States on March 30, 2020","I ordered my MacBook Air from Apple within an hour of its announcement and have been enjoying it for a few days. I'm upgrading from a 2018 retina MacBook Air, and the 2020 model is a very worthwhile upgrade for a few reasons.First, the new keyboard really lives up to the hype.  I didn't hate the butterfly keyboard, but I didn't like typing on it nearly as much as the scissor-mechanism keyboards of the older MacBook Airs and pre-2016 MacBook pros.  Plus, I've had two machines with the butterfly keyboard (the other was the 2016 MB Pro with Touch Bar, that my employer provided me to use at work).  Both had problems with repeating keys, and in the case of Pro I use at work, some key presses randomly triggered some of the Touch Bar functions.The keyboard on my new MacBook Air is, to me, much more comfortable to type on, and that's important - my job requires me to do a ton of writing - especially now that I'm working remotely from home.  (I teach at a small college in Wisconsin, and like all colleges except Liberty University we are now teaching online only.)The 2018 MB Air felt a bit underpowered to me, and you could not custom-order it with a better processor.  (Ditto for the 2019 Air).  So I was really happy that the new Air has different processor options.  I got the middle one, the quad-core i5 and my 2020 Air feels ridiculously fast compared to the 2018 model.  I don't really need the extra power right now, but having it will extend the useful life of the computer by a couple years, probably.  The quad-core i5 processor is only $100 more than the base processor, a dual-core i3.  It's a worthwhile upgrade for anyone who can afford it.  I don't recommend the i7, thought.  It costs $150 more than the i5 but published benchmarks show that it's only slightly faster.  The i5 is the sweet spot.When school shut down a couple weeks ago, I brought home the 2016 MB Pro that school provided me for work.  I now have it next to the new MB Air.  The Air's display is not quite as bright or color-rich as the MB Pro's display.  But it is still fantastic, high-resolution, and the True Tone feature makes it look better than the Retina display on my 2018 MB Air.  I watched the first 20 minutes of Mad Max Fury Road on the new Air and it looked great. The speakers are totally adequate, though as with any laptop or iPad I usually use headphones or external speakers when I'm doing serious listening or watching a movie.Some people need the absolute best display on a MacBook though, for professional photo or video editing, and those people should get a Pro.  The current 13"" MB Pro has a relatively low starting price, weighs only 2/10 of a pound more than the Air, and has approximately the same footprint as the Air, so it's just as portable.  But the 13"" Pro still has the butterfly keyboard..  There's a good chance Apple will update the 13"" Pro with the new keyboard, so if you want a Pro and you don't need it immediately, it's probably a good idea to postpone the purchase.Back to the new Air.  The only thing I don't like that much is the webcam.  Now that I'm working remotely, I'm participating in video conferencing and video calls every day with students and professors using Zoom, Skype, and Google Chat/Hangouts/Meet.  The webcam on this machine is mediocre.  It's satisfactory, but Apple has put much higher-quality webcams in other products for years.  My iPad & iPhone have better selfie cameras.  In normal times, I would rarely use the camera on a computer; I use my iPhone & iPad for Skyping with my friends & family.  So it's not a big deal for me.  But it might be for you.But for the things that matter to me - the keyboard, the option to get a speedy quad-core processor for an extra $100, the Retina display - the 2020 MB Air gets all these things right.  I mean, really really right.  And compared to last year's model, it's $100 cheaper but comes with double the hard drive capacity.  Win!"

B0863D4XJW,Alex Stav,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing!,"Reviewed in the United States on April 14, 2020","Came in sealed. Easy to set-up. The screen is beautiful. The Magic Keyboard feels very nice and a definite upgrade from the previous butterfly mechanism. The camera quality is just what I need. If you are going to be at school or at work doing zoom calls with other people, they can see you clearly. The camera, in my opinion, could definitely be improved, especially because of that high price. That seems to be the only “flaw.” Lastly, I will talk about the fan noise and the MacBook “heating up.” In my personal use, the MacBook never heated up (even on the bottom) and the fan was only heard just a bit when I was downloading a large app file. From day-to-day use of browsing, Netflix, zoom calls, and presentations, you would most likely never hear the fan nor feel the heat from underneath your keyboard. I’d definitely recommend this computer, especially if it’s your first Mac. Enjoy!Update: After less than a week of purchasing, this MacBook still works fantastic. However, once I started up Minecraft and played creative for just 2 minutes, the fan started blasting and was very loud. I do not suggest this computer if you want to game, however, for daily usage, it's wonderful."
B0863D4XJW,Kenneth L. Meador,2.0 out of 5 stars,i3 not adequate for Zoom,"Reviewed in the United States on May 21, 2020","First, I am a loyal Mac user. I ""upgraded"" from a (base model) late-2013 MacBook Pro to this Air assuming I was getting a better product. For the most part, this computer is awesome. Its a brand new Macbook. What's not to love?Well, in the age of coronavirus, two crucial things, the camera and the i3's inability to use virtual backgrounds on Zoom. I was shocked the first time that I used the webcam on this and, even though I thoroughly research the device, I did not really realize how antiquated this tech is. The picture is grainy, low-res, and inadequate for my needs. So, then I tried to use a virtual background. I received a notice that I needed an i5 processor in order to use that feature.I'm in the process of exchanging this laptop for a Pro, but I'll be honest, I feel a bit ripped off. I'm like the Apple OS and appreciate that I don't have some of the issues that I had when I was a PC user, and/or with my PC at work. But if I had spent $1000 for a new PC I wouldn't have a 10 year old camera and a processor that can't handle Zoom virtual backgrounds. I would be able to do these basic tasks with even a $500-750 PC. Now I'm stuck paying an extra $300 for a computer that can handle these very basic tasks.So, my suggestion for you, if you're using this for Zoom/work/webcam meetings pay now for the i5 and be aware that the camera on this laptop is not very good."

I wanted to give this a try because a few friends had recommended the new air to me. I didn’t expect much, but I got even less than expected. It’s just not very good. Yes, it’s a Mac product and it does work, but super slowly. It heats up very fast, and if you try having two applications open at the same time it freezes up. I don’t know why this has so many good reviews, other than people reviewing that don’t use their computer much/only like the look of a Mac.

I loved that computer and it served me well. I had virtually no problems with it during the five years that I had owned  it. It recently died on me and would no longer boot up correctly. Since it was time for an upgrade I decided to buy a new laptop instead of getting my old one fixed. This time around I opted for the Macbook Air since it was a little more price friendly. I also don't do too much heavy lifting on my computer besides surfing the internet, work and watching videos. The MacBook Air is a dream so far! One thing to note is that it looks more rose gold than gold. If you have the iPhone 11 Pro Max it is not that sort of gold. It looks pink to my eyes. Pink is my favorite color so I LOVE IT! But if you want a more traditional gold color you may be disappointed. I love the new finger print sensor. It makes unlocking your computer super easy and you don't have to type your password a million times. I have not really missed the USB thingy and standard headphones do work so that's a plus. So far this computer is boss. Apple never really disappoints me though so take that with a grain a salt.  :)"
B0863D4XJW,Steven Johnson,1.0 out of 5 stars,It’s 2020 Apple-upgrade the crappy camera already.,"Reviewed in the United States on May 4, 2020","The fact that it is 2020 and Apple can’t find the time to upgrade the MacBook Air camera is simply stupid. My X has a better camera than the 2020 Air. Despite repeated software reboots, for calls to Apple Care, no improvement. So I sent it all back from where it came."
B0863D4XJW,Angie,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Sleek, but terrible cam... C'mon!","Reviewed in the United States on May 8, 2020","This is my first Apple laptop. It came very nicely wrapped in an original box from Apple. It did warm up a tiny bit when I was on a long Zoom call, but nothing crazy. It is fairly different (frustrating) from a Windows computer when it came to using their Pages, so I'll definitely be downloading Microsoft Office. It does have a very sleek, minimalistic look, which is how they get you to pay almost 1k for it. I was very disappointed in the camera, terrible qualify, which is why I gave it 3 stars, unacceptable. I feel like even my Acer from 4 years ago has a better cam than this thing. Overall, I think it will do what I need it to do, which is to be sleek and light for the purposes of going to class. This will not convert into an Apple fan girl, I can tell already. Camera alone should make this $150 cheaper."
B0863D4XJW,Ryan,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not Worth The Price,"Reviewed in the United States on June 27, 2020","I was really excited to use my new Macbook however I was very dissapointed when I used it for a few days. The two biggest things this laptop is missing is a better processor (the 10th gen i3 just isn't enough to run Photoshop or any program efficiently) and it has a 720p camera. WTF Apple? What year is it.  I dont think I've had any camera in 720p in over 6 years. The retina display is nice as always but it IS NOT WORTH THE PRICE!! You can get a much nicer laptop around the same price or cheaper. Look into the Lenovo Flex(i7, 16gb ram, 512gb ssd) is what I recommend."
B0863D4XJW,Agent007,3.0 out of 5 stars,Heats up,"Reviewed in the United States on July 18, 2020","I was really looking forward to this laptop. I bought a refurbished MacBook last summer that I was going to give my daughter with the intention of keeping this one. It really is a new MacBook, unopened in box, which i was worried about not being. Five minutes after turning it on the keys felt hot, as well as the bottom of the computer. There was no fan noise. I looked up online ""MacBook 2020 heating up"" and found that people where complaining about it heating up and the fan loudly kicking in when using heavier video conferencing software. For a nearly 1k computer, that is unacceptable. The refurbished 2017 one doesn't even heat up! I will sadly have to return this :( Sucks, because it's beautifully designed, the keys are quiet and the fingerprint feature impressive. But I cannot get over it heating up the way it did."

Not even 2 week with this new laptop its defected.  I requested a refund and was short $100.  Be careful when ordering through 3rd party.  Even if you return the item before the estimated allowance they will still charge 20% restocking fee.  Why should I pay $100 for a defected item?  Not a happy customer!!! Very disappointed.

B0863D4XJW,L,4.0 out of 5 stars,A nice update to a classic!,"Reviewed in the United States on May 10, 2020","I’m upgrading from a 2014 MacBook Air, and the things I like and dislike are largely the same (that’s not a bad thing!)The form factor is not new, but it is still great. It’s the perfect size and weight if you ask me; It slips into a backpack or carryon easily but it is perfectly useable. My last model lasted forever without problems. The hinge is nice, the body feels just right.The screen is bright, the colors are rich. It automatically adjusts to brightness, and this feature is better implemented than any computer or phone I’ve used—it’s hardly noticeable but always seems to be perfectly adjusted.The keyboard is not bad...all the reviews seem to be in love with the keyboard, but it’s hard to notice any improvement from the 2014 model (the much-criticized butterfly mechanism was introduced in 2015 and retired before this model was introduced). I like that it is backlit.  The trackpad is larger and pressure-sensitive, but I haven’t noticed much of a difference in day-to-day use.  The webcam is also unimpressive compared to more modern phones or dedicated webcams...it’s often grainy and gives poor results in low light. I thought that the addition of a fingerprint reader was a gimmick, but I actually love how it makes logon and payment through Apple Pay a snap!The performance is a bit disappointing; it’s not noticeably snappier than my 2014 MacBook Air, and compared to my two year old Windows-based Intel i5 desktop, it’s slower. It’s not terrible and it doesn’t take away from the user experience, but it doesn’t have that snappy new computer wow-factor.The port selection is anemic.  It has just two USB-C ports and a headphone jack compared to my 2014 MacBook Air which had two USB-A, a MagSafe charging port, a headphone jack, an SD card reader, and a ThunderBolt port. I miss the MagSafe connector, which saved my computer from harm and me from embarrassment more times than I’d care to admit. In practice, I can use all the same ports as before, but only if I use a dongle for just about anything. There are a couple neat tricks that USB-C brings to the table; you can charge from a battery pack, use your computer to charge your devices, and the charging speed is much faster.The software has a couple neat updates to Mac OS that I really like. SideCar allows you to use an iPad as a second screen, which I really appreciate when doing work. The computer automatically deletes installers after you’re done with installation, which is a welcome touch!All in all, it’s not perfect but it’s nice update to a classic, and generally hits the right notes."

The time has arrived and this product did not disappoint.First off, the gold color is vibrant. I didn't have a hard time migrating all my data and apps from my old MacBook to this new one (took maybe 3 hours, but I have iCloud), and everything is running seamlessly so far. Fast performance and will definitely be of great use once I get to editing all of my photos.Highly recommend!"
B0863D4XJW,Lookin' Pretty,4.0 out of 5 stars,Too Hot,"Reviewed in the United States on May 17, 2020",I purchased this MacAir to use for 6-8 hours of distance learning and teaching during The Corona pandemic. On day one of using the laptop after 6 hours of continuous use the machine had overheated to the point that even the internal fan could not keep it cool. The laptop was excessively hot to the touch. I unplugged it and contacted Apple. The customer service rep at Apple stated this particular laptop had had some cooling issues and made a suggestion for another model.

B0863D4XJW,Craig Knowles,2.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed,"Reviewed in the United States on July 10, 2020","Received and set up computer and began using it.  In the very first hours I was informed I needed an OS update.  This is precisely why I wanted to get away from Windows. So after some time the download failed. A few days later I allowed it to do it again and this time it was successful in the eyes of Apple.  Now my password was required to use the fingerprint feature and I soon discovered my password no longer worked. I got on the phone with Apple support and finally was able to open up my computer. Then I found out I needed to open or create iCloud account. I had already done that. To make a long story short it now believes I have two computers, the Apple air Mac and Craig's Apple air Mac. I'm seriously considering returning it. I don't need to pay nearly $1,000 for this aggravation when I can get a Chromebook that will satisfy my computer needs for a third of that price."

I had a mac from 2004-2012, and I loved that machine. It was a tank!  However, this from the moment I opened the box was a huge letdown. This is just my personal preference but it feels so delicate,  and like I'm going to break it at any moment. I automatically knew I was going to need a case for it.  The second thing that shocked me was how hot the bottom of the machine got almost instantly. Just surfing the internet caused it to heat up way more than my 5 year old Acer laptop (that barely turns on most days.) Thirdly, this thing gets loud! And that's just from watching videos while doing some very basic work. It's not the Macs of old that I remembered and loved and I decided it just wasnt worth the expense to have something I wasnt 100% happy with."
B0863D4XJW,Angelica Addeo,2.0 out of 5 stars,I3 processor disappointing,"Reviewed in the United States on April 29, 2020","I purchased this hoping for the best but honestly, if you are used to a faster processor, do not buy this computer. If you’re looking for a basic computer to do basic things like surfing the internet and running a few different things at the same time but nothing major like video editing, then this computer is for you. I am honestly disappointed they would put an i3 processor in their base model computer but I guess you can’t get everything. Other than that, the size was definitely smaller than I’m comfortable with. Before purchasing, consider the speed because it will completely alter your experience in the long term."

First of all, the gold color is too cute. It is so compact and a great size laptop, I love it! it works as fast as is user friendly as you would expect from a MacBook. I've only owned MacBooks so I stuck with what I knew. The tracking pad took me a minute to get used to, but I like it. A few things I can't stand though: The keyboard sucks. It is a little awkward typing because you can't really feel the keys. They are too flat. Also, why is there no USB-A input?!! You have to buy an adapter for USB-A and to charge your phone. For a $1000 computer, you would think they could throw that in there. But So far, those are the only downfalls, but I love this computer."

I don't believe in posting negativity forever.This review sits right in the middle, hence the 3 stars.I've been on team Apple for about a decade (iPods, MacBook, iPhones...you get it)I decided to upgrade my 2014 MacBook Air for the 2020 model. I read a ton of reviews, watched a bunch off Youtube vids on it, and went ahead and bought it on Amazon.The Pros;Nice look. Sharp. Nice keys. Easy to navigate. I'm not a ""tech"" person so I can't talk about the Flux Capacitor and the internal combustion engine etc. It works well so far.... I need my computer to run my business (and personal). I spent hours and hours per day on it. It's a huge party of my life and a huge part of running my company is using Zoom and having fast Internet...so on to the Cons.The Cons;2 huge cons.... the camera is SOOOOOO grainy and looks like it was fitted on a 1999 computer. It's terrible. I'm shocked Apple would green light something so terrible. My 2014 Macbook camera ROCKS! This one does not. It is way way below the standard Apple has set, in my eyes.The second thing is the ports on the side are all USB C ports now. So, knowing this in advance, I bought an Anker adapter so I could plug in cables such a microphone...USB....SD card....HDMI and ETHERNET into it.But......within the computer itself, the computer is not reading/accepting the ETHERNET cable. I desperately need to be ETHERNETTED to my router (not WiFi) to run my company. The Ethernet cable works on my 2014 just fine. I youtubed and googled to find a way around this and could not find any solutions. VERY, VERY disappointing.The two MAIN things I need to run my business.....it fails...BIGTIME.I am still on team apple....I will still buy your products, but I am bitterly disappointed in this MacBook. :(- Garry"

Once it opened it, the apple box was greasy and dirty, even the laptop itself was dirty, had minor damage and was apparently used. Keep in mind, I had ordered a new item. I called support and they immediately ordered a replacement for me. I expressed the need to have it home desperately since I need it for work and I was told that since I’m considered international shipping, I would have to wait 7 days for it. Well, I agreed but mentioned that I needed him to reassure me that it would in fact arrive upon this estimated time since I couldn’t wait longer. Well, it was supposed to be delivered today and it’s late, hasn’t even been updated in Tracking Information since the 23rd and is apparently still in Miami when I live in Puerto Rico. So basically, I have been almost an entire month waiting for what I ordered. Please refrain yourself from ordering here if you’re interested in getting a quality product.

It was faster than my older MacBook Air. (E.g. 3-times faster on shut-down.)I was disappointed that battery life wasn't improved.I was dismayed that they had an entirely different connection for the charger. They replaced the magnet connector, making it possible, once again, to trip on the cord and bring the computer smashing to the ground. I also missed the status light that, on the old connector, would tell you at a glance whether it was connected to power, if it was charging, and when the computer was charged. I had to buy an adaptor to use my old chargers with the new unit.I missed the RS-232 connector. I had to buy an adaptor before I could use my external back-up drives.Transferring data from my Time Machine was a pain. The MacOS on my old computer was newer than on the new one so nothing could happen until I updated the OS on the new computer. (Transferring content from the old computer to the new should be easier. And in the past it was much easier.)The finger-print reader was much more hit-and-miss than on my iPhone.It's still probably the best light-weight lap-top on the planet."

B0863D4XJW,JT,4.0 out of 5 stars,Pleased Overall,"Reviewed in the United States on June 25, 2020","With the exception of a 24-hour period previously, this is my first Mac. In fact, I just moved over to Apple products recently after being anti such for many years.The first one arrived with that retina laminate bubble problem many are speaking of. Requested replacement through Amazon immediately and a replacement arrived the next day. So far, this screen seems fine. The camera is definitely a gripe. However, if I am being honest, I never used the webcam on my previous PC (which luckily still works and has a great camera) until the pandemic. My guess is most people wouldn't have even noticed or been inconvenienced by the low grade quality of the camera on the MBA 2020 if it weren't for the current circumstances and what is now a greater need for the technology. These are expensive machines (obviously) so I definitely made sure to buy a protective case for it as well as a keyboard cover.Also important to point out are the improvements to the keyboard. The previous aforementioned MB model I had in my possession for less than 24 hours was returned because I just couldn't see myself being able to adjust to the butterfly keyboard. Kudos to Apple for seeing the need for doing away with that.I would love to give it a 5, but the slight anxiety I have over the potential for Retina display issues going forward and the unfortunate decision to not upgrade the webcam made it so that I couldn't. However, a 4 rating is high for me and one that I would seldom give any product, so this definitely a product that I recommend if one is interested in crossing the river over to Apple."

My old Mac was a MacBook Pro 13' 512GB and 4GBs of RAM. I know I know. I upgraded with a MacBook Air 2020 for $1199.00 512GBSSD,  8GBs of RAM I5. The fan is on after about fifteen or twenty  minutes of internet browsing and you hear it in high definition, without much load at all the fan is on and it's not turning off. What ever battery life Apple says you're getting its on the lowest display setting so forgetaboutit. I turn my display up to about seventy five percent and that gives me about five hours of use unplugged. The computer is okay for what I use it for, but I would not recommend it to a friend, I might recommend to an enemy."

The ""quad core i5"" in mine might as well be an i3; it music cuts out when I'm listening to podcasts and challenging the device by surfing the web.  It's underpowered for multitasking.I wanted to believe that by upgrading to the higher echelon model I'd be ditching a lot of the complaints I read about, but I've immediately found that's not the case.  No getting around the 2GHz MBP 13"" in my world - hoping at least that can handle two things at once with a decent camera."

It has done that SEVERAL times since then. One afternoon, I was watching YouTube and the sound randomly went out. It also often restarts on its own. And now, it is incapable of remaining connected to my WiFi, despite the fact that I've remained connected on my work computer (an ANCIENT Lenovo ThinkPad) all night.I called Apple and the woman walked me through a soft reset as if that was going to solve ALL of the problems I've had with this computer.

I won't divulge into computer specs because your mileage may vary (YMMV), but rather talk about the experience from getting it from Amazon.SHIPPING 5/5Received the product 2 days after I placed the order, even got $50 off of what you'd get from an Apple store (on top of the extra Amazon Prime card cash back). The Amazon package contained cushioning and the actual Macbook box snugly fit inside a smaller, custom box.PRODUCT CONTENTS 5/5Everything is good.COST/SUPPORT 4/5Good price, even get $50 off of Apple price, but there's a caveat with the Apple 1-year warranty. I looked up the serial number on Apple's website and I can't verify the purchase date to set up my warranty. (I think the $50 offsets the price of the 1-year warranty, so you may want to get it from an Apple retailer). I've reached out to Amazon's customer support and have gotten mixed messages such as contacting the official manufacturer for warranty to contacting Amazon customer support for warranty issues. Now here's to hoping I don't run into any mechanical issues, but I can already imagine this being an issue where they bounce you between the two companies shirking responsibilities. The good thing is you have 90-days to return it from Amazon's website directly, the bad part is from day 91-365, you will have to go through Amazon customer support. I don't know how hassle-free it is nor do I hope to find out. YMMV."

I’ve wanted this MacBook Air for SOOO long and Apple did not disappoint! It is such a beautiful design and extremely user friendly. It’s my first Mac and I was able to turn it on and start using it right away. My favorite feature so far is handoff and how well it syncs with all my other Apple products.
B0863D4XJW,Esther,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good computer, not so good camera","Reviewed in the United States on May 20, 2020","It’s an awesome computer.I had an old MacBook Air that stoped working (my fault) so had to get a new one.Got this MacBook Air because of its light weight and because I loved my old one so much.Downside? The Camera is 💩Because we’re doing so many things (church, meetings, school ...) over zoom and Skype I thought that because this is a new model the camera was going to be better than the one I previously owned, but no. It might be just me but I think it’s actually worse.But that’s on me too because I didn’t really look up the camera details before buying it.(It’s not THAT bad, but it’s not as good as you would expect it to be).Overall it’s an awesome computer, I just wish the camera quality was better.So if you’re looking for a computer with a great camera to do video conferences with, this ain’t it.But other than that’s it’s a great computer.I wouldn’t use it for heavy gaming tho, but if you are a gamer then you probably don’t need me to tell you this haha.God bless!"

All I want to do is download a few CDs into iTunes. DVD drives don't work so I bought an expensive Apple drive that doesn't fit, so I bought a adapted. Now it says accessory USB needs power. On-line support is not helpful.Downloading files for my 3D printer was a pain too.

The box arrived perfectly sealed, and everything inside had no scratches or dents! Battery life has been good (I'll give an update on that if anything changes) and the speaker is great. Fast, brand new, and pretty!!UPDATE: SEPT 7TH, 2020Okay, so it works fine but it keeps doing this THING where my keyboard stops working and makes an error noise whenever I type, as well as pops up menu bars whenever I click on ANYTHING. I have to reboot the system while it's plugged in, and then it continues to work normally but this happens ALL THE TIME. Like, way too often and it makes the computer very annoying to use lol. I'm trying to talk to customer service and stuff to see what I can do, because otherwise I'm just gonna send it back tbh"

I wish I would’ve saved myself the extra $300 or some dollars by getting the lesser SSD storage space version. Other than that.

B0863D4XJW,Sammy B,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love the speakers!!!,"Reviewed in the United States on June 6, 2020","You might be surprised that the feature I am impressed with the most in this laptop is the speakers. Well I have a Mac mini already so  am already familiar with Mac OS and the Mac experience in general so a lot of good qualities thereof did not come as a surprise, but as I casually played a song I was like WOW where is this stereo sound coming from? I have a pair of bluetooth Harman-Kardon speakers in my bedroom so I was thinking maybe it automatically connected to my laptop and this is where the sound is coming from.Now I never really thought of using my laptop to play music as, like I said,  I have other devices that are more capable of that but now I am thinking it seems like a good idea because my external speakers are too strong and might cause noise for my downstairs neighbor especially late in the evening."

Save your money.,"Reviewed in the United States on April 22, 2020","I received this item on April 22, 2020 and the same day I got it, my wife already started getting keyboard problems with the spacebar. I looked up some research and apparently the butterfly keyboard design is giving a TON of people all sorts of issues. We even tried installing the Unshaky app, and mess with the apple keyboard preferences. I honesty think charging this much money with a flaw design is a waste of money, especially at this stage for Apple. They're are a lot of other laptops that will work better than this."
B0863D4XJW,Penny Warner,4.0 out of 5 stars,MacBook Air,"Reviewed in the United States on July 9, 2020",I love my MacBook Air. It takes a little learning curve if you're coming from a Windows PC environment but easy to learn. Having an iPhone MS Max and a iPad Pro helped in the learning curve. The only negative is that I'm disappointed in the battery life. I need to charge it every 3-4 days.

I am SO glad that I did. It's such a rich and smooth experience that can't be described unless you see for yourself. The keys are like butter. The display is incredible. The touch-ID is super convenient. It's as light as a feather. And I love how my MacBook ""communicates"" with my iPhone and Apple Watch.I was worried that I'd have a tough time figuring out how to navigate the operating system because I'm not very tech-savvy, but within a few hours I figured everything out just fine. I will NEVER settle for Windows again. Like my headline says, ""Once you go Mac, you never go back."" LolI mainly purchased this because I needed a new device to trade stocks on after my old Dell PC took a dump. This MacBook is lighting fast and allows me to complete my work so efficiently. I do, however, recommend buying a USB-C hub because you won't be able to connect any accessories without it.Just buy it already."

I have been searching for the right Macbook at the right specs and the right price.  This Mac has given me all that.  I have 512 GB of HDD space.It has a SSD for a fast boot up.  Even the reboot is quick.What I like about it is there is no AntiVirus needed to install to hunker down my computer.  Just do the update patches when requested.My windows PC has a lifespan of 5 years for the last 3 PCs.  I'm expecting this one to last me at least 10."

B0863D4XJW,Doug from Fort Lauderdale,5.0 out of 5 stars,Macbooks are simply the best...,"Reviewed in the United States on August 28, 2020","I purchased my last Macbook in 2014 and used it constantly for work and personal business.  It's only failure was that the keyboard gave out two years ago when individual keys began falling out.  Solution?  An Apple bluetooth keyboard which fit perfectly over the built-in one.  That Mac is still working great (and is now my backup one) but I finally decided to upgrade.  The 2020 model is modestly better than my old one - faster, crisper screen images, fingerprint login, etc.  But with Apple having already set the bar so high, it's difficult for Macbooks to get tremendously better.  Macs offer amazing security and a reliable, durable, long lasting laptop that will last years and years - an amazing return on one's investment.  Some say Apple devices are no longer ""exciting"".  Who knows?  For me, exciting means amazing quality that lasts and lasts."

But once that was done, this laptop is beautiful in form and feature. High quality screen, and fast! I was concerned with being able to download apps I use. However, with the correct downloading procedures, my fears were unfounded. Unfortunately, the camera is grainy and dull, which is odd in light of the top quality of this device. It's too bad Apple cannot enhance the MacBook Air's camera quality to match the high quality cameras found on their iPads, and iPhones. Go figure."

I paid extra for more storage space, but I had some issues getting things transferred from my iPhone and iPad to the MacBook. I would move things over and delete them from other devices and they would be deleted completely from the laptop as well (which defeated the purpose of having extra storage space and clearing out my cloud). I just turned off the iCloud and airdropped. So I suppose it was just my personal user tech problem. Maybe other people are more tech savvy. But anyway, all and all, I am so happy with this. Great purchase!!"
B0863D4XJW,Andrew J. Holland,5.0 out of 5 stars,Welcome to Macintosh™,"Reviewed in the United States on October 25, 2020","Macs continue to be dependable machines with a long life. Recently, a 2011 MacBook Pro I'd picked up used kicked the bucket. I removed its HD and was easily able to migrate my apps, preferences, account data, etc., into this new Macbook Air with Migration Assistant. It was like resurrecting my old machine only under the OS Catalina which my unit arrived with. This was an Amazon Warehouse Deal, which I've had luck with over the years. It arrived looking brand new, even the packing was perfect. Setting up a Mac is ridiculously intuitive and easy. If you're coming from an older machine as I was, some of your apps will be incompatible with latest OS and file system, but for me it was a very small % of what I brought over.I paired the unit with a keyboard cover and laptop casing and am using USB-C to USB adapters to use my old drives with this Mac. The screen is nice and bright with plenty of detail. I regret having not used the camera yet, as I never make calls from my laptops, so I cannot comment on its quality. I've read it pales in comparison to the quality of an iPhone camera, which baffles me. It's got some weight to it compared to my previous MacBook Air. Handles streaming video like a champ and runs demanding apps like Adobe programs. The keyboard and track pad took a few days to acclimate myself to, but feel great now, and you always have the option of using a mouse.My device boots up fairly quickly and the power button/fingerprint reader is a welcome addition. You can still type in your pass if you prefer, but the touch button is very reliable.Battery life seems solid. It's just a nice quality product. I've had PC laptops, but prefer Macs. If you're already a Mac fan, you should appreciate this machine. I highly recommend this model. We've come a long way from the IIe."

I was skeptical after reading some of the negative reviews, but I saw a few glowing ones and crossed my fingers I would get one like them. I have heard no whirring sound from it. And no more heat than any other laptop I have had, actually less heat than the last Dell I had. I will be keeping it."
B0863D4XJW,bmbutler,4.0 out of 5 stars,Works great and highly recommend except for THE FAN,"Reviewed in the United States on April 25, 2020","****Update. I bought this MacBook Air to use for online teaching.  It works great and the colors are awesome.  One BIG problem - THE FAN.  It is SO loud that makes me hearing my students difficult.  Others had written about the same thing.  I had to take away one star for that because it is VERY ANNOYING.Bought this to use for online teaching. Very easy to setup and sync to my Mac to get the data and apps from it. Some have complained about the camera. I do notice that the video quality when you start FaceTime can be grainy for some reasons, but it resolves after a few seconds. Highly recommend. (Note to Amazon:  when you offer a lower price within 1-2 days of a customer receiving their order, just give them the difference back to their form of payment. Making me erase my personal data and ship back the first one is a waste of time and money.)"
B0863D4XJW,Jaleesa Robinson,2.0 out of 5 stars,not zoom/ teams friendly - FAN BLOWS AIR,"Reviewed in the United States on October 22, 2020","I initially bought this MacBook Air because I leant my older model out a family member to use during the pandemic. I am pleased with the look and feel of the air and the screen is sturdy and sits upright, the sound is wonderful however, there are a few reasons why I will be returning this MacBook Air.1) Video calls will heat up the laptop. I barely downloaded anything to this MacBook Air and I've had it for 4 days. During my first video call, the fan was blowing during most of my teams meeting. I find that to be unacceptable because the previous model I had NEVER did that. A lot of us are working and schooling from home and it just seems like a buzzkill to keep this laptop if the fan is going to going off constantly.2) the camera is awful. one of the worst I've ever seen in laptop history. its very grainy and delayed.I really wanted to like this newer version but it really lacks quite a few things to make it worthwhile.I hardly write reviews but, I really wanted to let the people know that this? it ain't it.  If you really want a MacBook Air, I suggest purchasing the 2015 version. I believe I am also looking into getting the MacBook Pro since I have a hefty music catalog."

Using Migration Assistant made it easy to transfer all my data from old to new computer.  The fingerprint touch feature is great for entering password.  New Air even showed me how to do it when I am visiting password sites, one touch and it enters my user name and password.  Haven't used the camera yet so I can't review that but I have a bunch of freestanding cameras so that aspect not important to me.Sounds, pictures and movies are outstanding.  It seems to throw sounds like a ventriloquist and it still startles me that something else is not in the room, just the speakers.

This AirPro had great reviews. So I made the plunge. And almost drowned from the set-up. Mac is usually easy to get into, but this product? Couldn't get past the annoying, yappy voice that attempted to lead me through goodness knows what. And I couldn't switch off the voice. Gave up. Packed it up and sent it back.BTW. my old Mac required simple info, and I was up and running. Whatever Apple is doing now, hurts the non-techie customer.

Battery seems to last for quite some time off of charger, not sure if it will last ten hours as advertised, but it sits idle for long periods and during use not requiring a charger cord. Online support has been helpful, not a ton of advertisements or purchases for programs as windows HP traditionally uses.

It's fine and it meets my needs for running basic updated software, but as other reviewers have stated it does heat up fast and the fan starts running after a very short time of use.Also, I am going to have to do some research about moving docs around on the desktop, apparently my idea of'drag and drop"" is outdated and ineffective. This new multi-purpose trackpad has a lot of ""features"" and ""options"" built in, i've read, but I'll have to do some relearning to figure out what they are and get used to them.I did love how the Voiceover feature started automatically upon setup, which i imagine is extremely helpful for users with visual impairments. As my eyes get worse, I'm sure I'll use that feature to read documents and articles to me."

Nice rose gold color.cons:Very slow. Even $200 computer can perform better than this.

B0863D4XJW,Wilfred Mulenga,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great laptop but slightly overpriced (IMO),"Reviewed in the United States on August 16, 2020","First, I must state that I ordered this laptop through a carrier as I am not in the U.S. So the carrier helped ship it to my country, Zambia. When I got it, it did not has MacOS pre-installed, which I thought was very weird. So I couldnt use any apps until I downloaded Catalina.I previously used a 2017 Macbook Air so I was pretty comfortable with this new model. The keyboard and display are my two favorite things about it. The keyboard buttons are smooth and easy to press. The laptop turns on and off incredibly fast and running several apps at once does not slow it down significantly. The build and weight is sublime.Now the things that I dont particularly like. The battery life compared to my previous 2017 Macbook Air is smaller. I guess because they had to reduce the size of the battery. But with the size of the display, I would say if I am using it intensively, I get about 4 hours. The display easily gets smudges and picks up dust so you are going to regularly feel the need to clean the screen. The charger cable feels short and it does not have that magnetic connector at the end to easily come out of the charging port. I feel that for the price they should have used an intel i5 and not i3 and it does make it feel slow when using several apps. If you are getting this laptop to do none intensive tasks like editing and viewing documents, watching videos, replying to emails, you will be more than happy with this. If you are a Software Developer, I don't think I would recommend this, because you might be running several tasks and might be held back a bit by this laptop and should go for a Pro if you can afford it. I couldnt thats why I chose an Air."

All of her friends have one and now she is apart of the mac book club. She has an iPad and iPhone and apple watch so this was all she was missing. She loves apple products and this is no exception, I am very satisfied with how fast it charged. I plugged it in for her so it would be fully charged and it was at 100% in 2 hours and I couldn't believe it. I love how thin and sleek it was and I am so happy she will have it for school now."

I have used them in schools and such but never owned until now. I do own the iPhone, iPod, iPad, and love everything about them!Delivery was great, on time, and the item was secured very well!Start up process was extremely easy but that may be because I already have an Apple ID, but still shouldn’t be hard for first time users!So far I love it’s speed, it’s sleekness, sharing between apples products, and camera quality isn’t terrible.One downfall is not having the usb or SD ports but you can easily purchase a docking station fairly cheap.This computer will be mainly for my sublimation business, so I’m not sure of the uphold just yet, (but I’m sure it will be better than my 2016 HP 2g RAM laptop) but will update in a month!It’s an awesome computer at an “Apple” reasonable price. I think it’s worth the money!Overall, Apple has done well and I will continue to purchase their items in the future!"

Recently began graduate school and needed a better laptop so I was advice to purchase a MacBook. I was advice to purchase a MacBook Pro but decided to go with the Air just because it was more affordable. At the moment I believe it was the best choice. It’s easy to transition from one application to the next. Setup was simple but it is different from the other computers so you’ll have to sit down and toy with it. Wish the camera was a little better but I’m not going to complain about that. Overall good investment for the next 2 years.

This new MacBook Air is amazing. I did not realize how convenient the fingerprint ID would be, the keyboard and keys feel amazing, and it's so light and thin. I only use my computer for schoolwork, administrative tasks, and social media, so I cannot speak to those who use video editing software or anything that requires buying a MacBook Pro.

B0863D4XJW,CT Phan,4.0 out of 5 stars,Defective charger and cord which need to be replaced.,"Reviewed in the United States on September 19, 2020","Not for publication: Upon plugging the Macbook Air into the charger, a continuous pinging noise happened. It continues for as long as I was setting up the Macbook Air which was about an hour. After much trial and error, I unplugged the brand new charger and the brand new cord, the pinging noise stopped. Finding: it is the brand new charger and cable that came with the Macbook Air which are defective. Poor quality control there. Once I replaced the brand-new charger and cord with what I already have for my iPad Pro 2019, there was no more noise. I will keep the computer but want to exchange the defective charger and cord for good new ones. Can Amazon help me with this by sending me a new thunderbolt charger and cord, and send me a MRA for the defective charger and cord?"

They keyboard is much more comfortable, and the ability to project/extend onto my ipad is a definite plus.However, the camera quality compared to the 2017 seemed to be much more pixelated and rough.

B0863D4XJW,Amazon customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"OK Macbook, kind of disappointed","Reviewed in the United States on November 13, 2020","I've always liked Macs for their lightweightedness, speed, and functionality, but I've found the designs in this line of Macs to be downright confusing or not helpful.A few of my issues:Yes, the lack of USBs means I can have more mobile devices (mouse, keyboard) - but it also means I have to do 1) extra remembering of having to charge these additional products, something that could be avoided with bringing back USB ports or 2) have to buy an additional, $70 external port to get USB access.The switch in side of the headphone jack has been disorienting. I use a 2017 Mac for work and am accustomed to having the jack on a certain side, only to have to relearn this for my new Mac. This feels counterintuitive of a product that is tried and true.Battery life - I had seen some positive reviews for this Mac, but the battery life has honestly been disappointing. I'm not sure if it's the bluetooth or some other electricity-draining function, but I often have to recharge after only a few hours.Charger cord doesn't signal charge - Unlike old Macs, this cord won't light up, so no way of knowing whether I am overcharging other than to open the screen and check (yet another hassle).Overall - I would probably avoid this Mac for the current price of $1299. Not sure if it's possible to buy a high quality 2017 or 2018 version, but if possible, I would go for those."

B0863D4XJW,yellowpixels,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Stepwise Improvements, Fewer Ports","Reviewed in the United States on October 18, 2020",Purchased to replace a 2017 MacBook Air.  Fewer ports overall.  Had to purchase an adapter to connect to usb-a devices like thumb drives. No SD slot. Smaller charger runs cooler than previous model. Display is an improvement. Keyboard seems  better than previous model. Speed/power overall feels similar.  Battery lasts longer as expected. Overall size is slightly smaller. Apple logo no longer lights up on back of display.

B0863D4XJW,nathan,2.0 out of 5 stars,Very bad Camera,"Reviewed in the United States on September 2, 2020",I would not recommend purchasing this labtop. I purchased this recently and my goodness the camera is horrible. My mom uses this and she said the camera looked like it was made in the 1990s. Worst camera I have seen from an apple product. Now I don't know if its just this particular model or if its just amazon that was bad but I definitely will be susceptible on future more expensive products of popular brands like apple. This was used primarily for zoom meetings and I can say the Ipad is way more advanced then this laptop.

I’ve read the reviews before purchasing it and and just like everyone said the camera quality is HORRIBLE, hence why I’m giving it 4 stars, It’s extremely grainy, so do not have high hopes for using the camera. Other than that this was a great purchase. I have all apple products and this is my very first MacBook."

Then it wouldn't let me back in! It wouldn't allow me to use Touch ID and didn't recognize my password. I still had the ten-year-old MacBook it replaced, so I searched (Google, certainly not Apple Help) and finally found a video with correct instructions for a command-R restart and resetpassword. Then it forgot my fingerprint, so I had to reset that. This is not a good omen."
B0863D4XJW,Patty Olascoaga,5.0 out of 5 stars,great computer for a great price,"Reviewed in the United States on October 5, 2020","I was looking for a Mac because I'm so used to having one, but I didn't want to pay full price...and I found this one for a couple of hundred dollars cheaper than if I were to buy the computer in new condition! it works great and super reliable, the only thing is that the camera quality isn't as good as my 2017 MacBook pro (I now have the 2020 MacBook air). But all in all, I love my new computer, and honestly, if I sit near a window or in direct sunlight, the camera quality is 10x better than if I were to be sitting in my room with regular lighting."
B0863D4XJW,Donna,1.0 out of 5 stars,Terrible battery life,"Reviewed in the United States on August 17, 2020",Not worth buying due to very poor battery life with just browsing the internet.

It’s a fantastic light weight laptop.Beware of the new ports - no more mini display ports and USB ports - these have two usb c ports - so you need an after market adapter to be able to use old keyboards, mice, drives, etc.  not the end of the world - but an extra cost to consider."

I just switched from an HP and I am SO happy with this purchase. I was really nervous because its so expensive but I'm so happy with the quality of this product. It has so many amazing features like the speakers, touch ID, touch pad swipe thing. It connects easily with my phone and I really like that feature. It had been AMAZING for all the online school I have to do as a college student right now. Its thin, light, and my battery lasts literally ALL day unless I'm doing a lot of zoom calls. One thing I don't like is that the camera quality for said zoom calls is not the best quality, but that's minor compared to the good qualities of this macbook."
B0863D4XJW,Laura Vaisman,2.0 out of 5 stars,Highly highly disappointed,"Reviewed in the United States on October 19, 2020",I bought this as an upgrade from my macbook mid 2010. I was super excited to get this but tell me why the camera on my old macbook is better than this one. How can that be? 10 years and you guys couldn't upgrade the camera quality? It's super grainy.  I contacted apple and they told me they most likely will not do a recall and will try to improve for the next model. And that they have been getting reports of the issue I have.Luckily my old mac is still running so I'm probably going to return this solely because of the camera.Also it kind of stucks there's no usb ports and you have to buy a separate piece to use that.

It is a little bit dirty, but that's on my part because I need to buy cleaning stuff for it.But overall the performance is amazing, it is still running fast and I absolutely love it. Buying this computer was the best thing I could have done, especially with being a college student. (It is worth it).But if you want to play games on here and stuff... you will need to buy the pro and not the air.The air is more for writing and doing different tasks related to that.Overall, I am in love."

Apple Support refused to replace the device and only offered a repair which will take several weeks.I've been waiting to purchase a Mac just because of the problems with the old butterfly keyboard. I've previously had bad experiences with the keys sticking and the new 'MAGIC' keyboard seems to be going back to the old functional design.Pros: - New Keyboard - Price (Compared to the previous-gen.) - Lightweight & ConvenientCons: - It doesn't turn on - I only had it 3 weeks before giving it back to apple - Apple can't tell me how quickly I'll get it back - Customer care wouldn't provide a replacement - No Cases (The new keyboard makes the device thicker, most cases that say they fit the 2020 DO NOT - Camera Quality ( Outdated camera only capable of 720p)Update: 5.21.2020Less than a month has passed since my MacBook air purchase and it died. Call support couldn't solve the issue and referred me to my local Mac shop. They now have my computer and suspect that it has a bad motherboard.

I had an early-release MBA 2010 which I loved (...and lasted perfectly until 2016 despite having a cracked plastic hard-shell, it was the base model too)...I decided to pick-up a MBP 2015 which was great at the time due to me doing a lot of video editing because my old MBA could do it BUT it took forever. My MBP 2015 still works fine BUT occasionally experience glitches and I realized it would be smart to get another Macbook especially since I'm working from home everyday during these covid-19 times.I no longer do video editing and wanted something that is great for everyday multi-tasking like web surfing, listening to music, watching YouTube/Netflix AND most of all doing office work.I was sold on getting the new MBA especially since I love it's sleek design, wanted the magic keyboard and I like the fact it's slanted at the keyboard (...I do a lot of typing and carpal tunnel is real). But I was turned-off by the ""overheating"" reviews, I'm happy I took a leap of faith and purchased the MBA 2020. I am able to multitask just fine WITHOUT this laptop overheating and I've had yet to hear any fan noise . Trust me I know all about loud MBA fan noise and the machine getting SUPER hot...I experienced it with my 2010 MBA and it would get so hot that I couldn't sit it on my lap.I know this MBA only has one fan and doesn't have a ""cooling system"" like the MBP...BUT people need to realize the heat is not getting trapped in the MacBook, it is being pushed out the back of the MBA. That's why the back of the MBA is warm at times (...not intensely hot) depending on how much you're pushing the laptop. The rest of the MBA remains cool and it's fine to use on your lap or in the bed while you're relaxing. This MBA is leaps and bounds away from the heat and fan noise I experienced in the past with the 2010 MBA.I think the bad ""overheating"" reviews are coming from people trying to do MBP activities with this MBA...it isn't meant for continuous intense video editing or as a device for serious gamers. It works perfectly for everyday multitasking (emails, web-surfing, live streaming movies/shows, watching Netflix, using Apple apps like FaceTime, light video editing like importing vids from your smartphone and using iMovie)...and most important I can use my job's remote client application with no issues on the MBA 2020. Also Apple products have safe-guards to prevent technical overheating...if the product is getting close to dangerous temperatures, it will literally shutdown to prevent damage.I purchased the gold, i5, 8GB memory and 516GB storage model...this thing is super fast even with multiple Safari tabs open, while utilizing Chrome to access my job's remote application, doing office work and listening to music at the same time might I add. Also I can't say this enough but if you won't be using this laptop for continuous intense gaming or professional photo/video editing...save some money AND purchase this laptop with confidence. You definitely won't be disappointed!!!"
B0863D4XJW,Publicagent,2.0 out of 5 stars,Noisy Fan + Awful Webcam- 16GB Memory no help,"Reviewed in the United States on June 22, 2020","This is the first Apple product that I have purchased that I don't like. I love my old Macbook Air from 2013. At the time, it was light and slick and fast. Fast forward 7 years and the MacBook Air is the cheap the version of the Macbook Pro. It's barely lighter, and it's almost as powerful, but it isn't.I missed the 14-day window, but I want to return this for 2 reasons:1. Noisy fan - Sorry, but using the web only, no movies up right now, just 8 tabs, nothing else open, and the fan is blaring. Sure I am not on a hard surface right now, but I am inside, it's cool, and this should not be happening with an Apple computer in 2020. The 16 GB of Memory I ordered makes absolutely no difference here.Another thing. I have an old iMac from around 2012. Not sure why, but the webcam on that is way better. This is actually one of the grainiest webcams I have seen. Had this not been opened from the beautifully sealed Apple Box, I would think it was a knock-off. I got it from Apple, not Amazon.If you are in the market, I would get a Macbook Pro or another brand. I purchased this because I imagined a slick, fast, lightweight computing experience to last a very long time. I didn't expect an annoying fan, and  a webcam that is unusable.Wish Apple would make the MacBook Air a much lighter, and much faster computing experience while cleaning up any fan issues. It's really awful to have fan issues in 2020. That shows negligence, and an engineering team that is trending downward.The Macbook Air has turned into a mass consumption low brow model. Don't get it."
B0863D4XJW,Erick C,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My first ever apple computer, I am in love!","Reviewed in the United States on July 29, 2020","I have owned iPods & iPads over the years but never had the money to purchase a Mac until now. I am so glad I did. This was a big purchase for me, I have never spent more than $300 on a laptop, I don't even own a RTX 2080 in my gaming PC. I work in IT and I felt not knowing much about Mac OS was sort of hindering me, so I just decided to spend the money and get myself a Mac to get acquainted with the operating system. I went with the base version (i3, 8GB RAM) and so far I have not noticed anything wrong with the performance. I am not a power user as far as editing video / photos by no means, but I'm sure this MacBook can handle it without an issue. My tasks include web browsing, email, music, electronic banking, and working on documents amongst a few other basic tasks. At first I felt like throwing down $900 on a MacBook just for these tasks was going to be a waste and a big time impulse buy, but I feel it will definitely come in handy. The color is amazing, I am so used to seeing the typical silver MacBook, but space gray is the best option IMO. It's super lightweight, the retina display is crisp & beautiful, the battery lasts a very long time, speakers are loud and clear, and the keyboard just feels so nice! The trackpad is really nice too with its many useful gestures. It does get slightly warm during extended use but that's to be expected since there's no vents for ventilation. I wish it had more IO like at least one USB A port, but nothing a hub can't fix. Also, I wish the components were upgradable like the RAM & SSD. 8GB RAM is definitely enough more than enough for basic day to day tasks. MacOS is super easy to navigate and everything just works. I will admit it takes a few more steps to get software installed, the OS is very restricted and requires admin privileges for almost anything, but it makes me feel secure. Touch ID is very nice and works flawlessly. I did install trend micro and Malwarebytes for security just to give myself some insurance on being secure. Having used Windows for many years, there are a few things that I need to remember works differently on Mac. All in all, a really great purchase, Apple definitely knocks out of the ballpark when it comes to quality, everything looks and feels premium."
B0863D4XJW,JCohen,1.0 out of 5 stars,Noisy!,"Reviewed in the United States on August 24, 2020","It's probably my 6th or 7th Macbook and I had my other iMacs and Mac Minis, so I'm very used to the behavior of the fans used by Apple. In this 2020 Macbook Air it's completely unacceptable. With light usage, web browsing, and emails, the fans if always at the max speed, around 8000 RPM. Very loud. Air-conditioned environment. No external accessories. No heavy software. I called them several times informing that A LOT of people are complaining about the same issue and they say that I have to send the machine. I'm working from home and I can't send it and wait for a week.  It's a clear design problem of the cooling system. It's loud and the lifespan of the fan will be short, of course, since it's always running at the highest speed.  I'm really disappointed with Apple.I bought it in June, so I can't return it. I can't even trade in the machine on the Apple website since they accept only 2019 models, no 2020 option. I don't know what to do."
B0863D4XJW,Stevie,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice Laptop, Much Improved Keyboard, Runs Hot, Uncomfortable on Lap","Reviewed in the United States on June 21, 2020","I bought mine on another website because Amazon didn't offer the configuration I wanted, which was 1.1 GHz 10th-generation i5 with 16 GB of RAM.  This laptop is absolutely beautiful.  The keyboard is fantastic improvement (I have a 12"" Macbook with the butterfly keys, and it's a horrible design with no key travel).  The Retina screen is gorgeous.  It's quick and responsive, and I love the new touch login button.  Like most Apple products, build quality is stellar.However, it runs quite warm.  Installed an app called ""Monity"" which shows CPU temperature among other sensor information.  It's not uncommon for the CPU in this version under normal browsing - not a heavy load - to run between 160 and 185F, which is 85C.  Much warmer - 20 or 30 degrees - than the 2.7 GHz i5 in my 2015 Macbook Pro sitting right next to it with similar use.  The numbers alone are one thing, but this laptop is uncomfortable to surf with while on in your lap. You can feel the heat emanating from the bottom under light use.  There are lots of forums with debates as to whether the i3 might be a better choice as some users say it runs cooler, which makes sense as it only has two cores and draws less power, though I haven't experienced it.  The i5 seems like a good performer, but this Macbook Air is noticeably warmer - uncomfortably so -  than the 2017 and earlier design of Air that I used to have.  Operating it on a surface, though, and not your lap is fine.  I have read that the new design does not have a a heat pipe from the CPU to the cooling fan, which seems like a strange change."
B0863D4XJW,Kid Judas,2.0 out of 5 stars,Annoying Fan,"Reviewed in the United States on September 26, 2020","After about 10 minutes of browsing FB or Reddit, the fan kicks in. It's LOUD. The fan is so loud, people can hear it when I'm in work meetings. Anything having to do with video or intensive graphics, the fan kicks in like the whole damn thing is about to lift off like a drone. Apple really dropped the ball with this computer and I'm out a grand on a piece of crap laptop. I expected a lot more from a brand new Apple product."
B0863D4XJW,Charles B.,3.0 out of 5 stars,Matter of preference,"Reviewed in the United States on July 27, 2020","Hi I’ve Found out I’m an iPad only user. I recently purchased a MacBook Air and found out quickly it wasn’t for me, I spend so much  time with my iPad Air (older version) I just couldn’t acclimate to a notebook computer I found it heavy with sharp edges that’s just not suited for someone that spends time on their back, I did  find the trackpad easy to use, and liked typing on a keyboard. The number of times I found myself reaching for the touchscreen was crazy and decided  within a few days I better return it to Apple, this is just a matter of personal preference. I do want to mention the heating thing, if you look at any video of the  internals the fan has no affect on the CPU. I could hear the fan kick on, with the bottom case becoming very warm, the gen10 processor also us 30% less energy than the gen8.  Apple isn’t always perfect in design. A lot of money to contribute to the CCP."
B0863D4XJW,Kevin Kao,2.0 out of 5 stars,2020 MBA Heat and Fan Noise,"Reviewed in the United States on June 23, 2020","We have a litany of Apple products around the house, including the 2020 MBA. With product knowledge and real life user experience, i'd recommend looking into this year's MBP instead. Without even opening up final cut pro or lightroom, this machine will heat up and the fan noise is distracting. I expect to comfortably run multiple browser tabs, jump on a zoom call, while presenting a slide deck, to not worry about unwarranted noise pollution from the fan. These are my baseline applications so YMMV. This is a hardware design issue. The heat sink is not connected to the fan and thus ceaseless noise and furthermore, a hot computer. Also, 2/5 camera quality due to 720p. Keyboard 5/5."

B0863D4XJW,Joaquin Anaya,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing intro MacBook or Great performing computer for computer work!,"Reviewed in the United States on July 10, 2020","This is my first MacBook and have used windows computers for a long time. This has been the best purchase I have made. I see many bad reviews for those who use a lot of CPU but not many of those who buy a computer who just use computers to reply to e-mails, create docs on word, excel, etc. and/or surf the web. Most of my online business relies on internet connection and basic tools like the ones mentioned. I do not need a lot of CPU power. This computer is extremely quick for what I need it for. Computer performs extremely well and best of all, it is a great inexpensive MacBook. Since it is the air, It is also VERY LIGHT. I've had a lot of computers that are HEAVY and cumbersome to carry around. You won't even realize this is in your bag! If you need a lot more computing power, this might not be the computer for you. But if you are the average student, just someone who browses the web, or your business relies solely on replying to emails and the occasional word doc or excel and occasional zoom call, this is the PERFECT computer for you. The only con is I wish the battery life was a little longer. Although I've spent a lot of time at home so that also doesn't pose an issue. 5 stars anyway because I know what I got into when purchasing. The camera also is just a very standard camera. Perfect for the occasional zoom call. This is really the best intro online business/student computer. If you are debating, debate no more. The new May 2020 MacBook Air was just upgraded to 256GB as a standard and more computing power. This is the right move."

Finally went to an Apple store as a walk-in because no appointments are available for weeks, spent 3 hours waiting and another hour with a tech to realize Amazon sold a repackaged brick. In fact, it was a refurbished product sold as new with third party parts and therefore voided Apple warranty. Amazon will not exchange it, either, so the product is going back but I wish I could say the same for the lost time and spent frustration."
B0863D4XJW,Rhashaad,4.0 out of 5 stars,overrated but not bad,"Reviewed in the United States on September 14, 2020","I wanted to try macOS out because I need to be versatile in the both operating systems and my gaming laptop motherboard went out. I wanted the pro, but got this. The pros of this laptop is def the battery life, I love the trackpad, the keyboard has grown on me, the screen resolution is nice, and it looks great, However with pros comes cons, and this laptop is very underpowered but I already knew that, it gets hot from having multiple tabs open and in zoom meetings, its running on a 9w processor. macOS file management is not good at all compared to windows, I can't use Microsoft access on this machine because its windows only, so as you may know there are compatibility issues. Overall however this is not a bad machine, it is a joy to do my lighter tasked school work on, if you are looking for one over a windows laptop, it all depends on what you are doing, personally I would not pick this over a Windows laptop due to compatibly issues, not being able to upgrade the hardware, and being that file management is terrible, however, I can see myself with both Operating systems. Its not a bad device but the YouTube and everyone else saying macOS is just to die for... Overrated machine and operating system"

B0863D4XJW,aliusha,4.0 out of 5 stars,Over Priced,"Reviewed in the United States on September 19, 2020",I honestly wouldnt get it for the price of the 512 gb model you could by  a decent high powered gaming laptop. Dont get me wrong it is a very good laptop but you could get something better for the same price.
B0863D4XJW,Jaden,5.0 out of 5 stars,PERFECT!!!! But....,"Reviewed in the United States on April 30, 2020",Absolutely perfect!!!! The only thing is you’d think Apple would include an adapter of some sort (Like they do for the iPhones) since there’s no USB ports or anything. But other than that the computer works perfectly. 100% Legit!!

B0863D4XJW,Frances A,5.0 out of 5 stars,great laptop!!,"Reviewed in the United States on May 12, 2020",my first and only macbook pro was purchased in 05/06. needless to say i was due for an upgrade. i was never a fan of the macbook air so i started researching the macbook pro. i quickly learned that most people i knew who had pro’s switched to the air when it came time to buy a new laptop. they all swear by it.  amazon didnt have any of the new pro’s in stock which is what finally pushed me over to the air. some reviews were iffy especially about the camera quality so i was very nervous. my laptop was delivered yesterday and i could not be happier that i chose the new macbook air! its perfect! while it does not come with the touch bar it does bring touch ID. many of the forums i read said the touch bar is great but you can live without it and after time it starts to fail. not sure how true that it as im sure itll improve over time.the air is so light weight. i got the 13inch and it doesn't feel crammed or too small like most air laptop do in previous models. the retina display is beautiful!the new air only has 3 ports for reference. see photos. you will need a USB adapter so that you can connect things like your harddrive or charge your mouse. i purchased the apple usb-c to usb adaptor on amazon for $17. i recommend getting one.i also purchased the magic mouse from apple for the laptop. if you are like me and you need a mouse this purchase is a must.the charger on these new laptops is probably the best part. its no longer the bulky long ones with two cords. see photo of new charger.the price on this laptop is also cheaper than the pro! 1300 for a pro and the air was only 979.  win winoverall i am very pleased with my purchase! if you need a personal laptop for the day to day this is a great buy!
