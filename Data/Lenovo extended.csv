B08122HHX9,Wyrd2010,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sleek, light, quick - so far, so good!","Reviewed in the United States on March 27, 2020","I bought my Lenovo Yoga C740 at BestBuy (the exact same color and specs that Amazon sells here and the exact same price) and have been using it for about two weeks. I will start with a possible warning, which may or may not turn out to be an issue - the laptop might be dropping randomly wifi connections. Mine did it a few times. Reconnecting is easy but no other laptop or any other smart device at home does it, so it might be a specific issue related to this laptop line. The Lenovo Yoga 730 and C940 lines appear to be having similar wifi issues and there are threads on the Lenovo forums about this problem, offering a number of possible solutions.Otherwise, the machine is very competent - light (about 3 lbs., 1.4 kg.), thin, comfortable, quick. Typing is easy, and the keys are very comfortable, the backlit keyboard has two settings, and the fingerprint sensor is accurate and fast. The battery is outstanding. It seems to last about 8-9 hours on full brightness and probably 14-15 hours on half (I read online reviews where it indeed lasted for 15 hours). The processor is good, although there are better 10th generation Intel i5 models out there, but the laptop is comfortably quick. The screen is bright, the colors are accurate and feel slightly warm. The webcam is fine (720p HD) and has a privacy shutter (a nice decision - it is built-in and requires you to slide it with your nails or with something very thin - the tiny sliding panel is located right above the webcam). The audio is quite loud, coming from a pair of Dolby Atmos speakers. The fan is quiet. It's a 2-in-1 type (Lenovo calls, in fact, a 4-in-1 ), and tablet mode also works well.The ports of the C740 are a bit unusual. It has two USB-C ports and one USB-A 3.1 port. You can charge it in any of the two USB-C ports (the charging adapter has a USB-C jack). It lacks an HDMI port. I bought a small hub from Amazon (QGeeM USB C Hub) that works well with it and has an HDMI port plus some more USB-A ports. I can also confirm that the laptop works well with a Wacom Bamboo Ink pen. It also works with a Lenovo Active Pen 1 or 2 (according to Lenovo). I only tested it with the Bamboo Ink stylus and have had no issues.One final word of caution: beware McAfee LiveSafe that might come pre-installed (the BestBuy model did). Years ago, I used to test AV software as a hobby. McAfee was always a pain to remove and would brick machines worse than other AV programs. This has not really changed over the years. On the day I bought this laptop, I almost returned it back to BestBuy, because after setting Windows 10 for the first time, McAfee got stuck with a bad update and I had to reset Windows because it became unresponsive and would load but then freeze. It was quite a fight to get it to start the resetting process because it would begin to do so and freeze again. After Windows was reset and McAfee removed, there have been no issues.To sum up, it's a nice, pretty stylish laptop. I would think that it is a bit overpriced (cheaper laptops from HP and Dell come with stronger Intel 10th generation i5 processors), but if you pair it against a MacBook (and it looks as nice or even nicer than a MacBook) - then the price would seems good."
B08122HHX9,Null,1.0 out of 5 stars,Frustrating experience,"Reviewed in the United States on August 10, 2020",Laptop was advertised as new but arrived in a Lenovo box with a broken seal and a user account already set up.  The return process took about three weeks from the time I shipped it back until the refund was issued.
B08122HHX9,D. B. Lingenfelter,1.0 out of 5 stars,RIP OFF,"Reviewed in the United States on August 13, 2020",Shipped without product key for windows 10. Runs on windows 8. TOTAL RIP OFF DO NOT PURCHASE.
B08122HHX9,Laura Hutchinson,1.0 out of 5 stars,Bad keyboard fresh out of the box— do NOT recommend,"Reviewed in the United States on August 13, 2020","Fresh out of the brand new packaging half the keyboard doesn’t work. “T”, “y”, backspace, both shifts, and caps lock are what I have noticed so far. Impossible to get anything accomplished with this. Immediately set to return it. Would NOT recommend as I’ve seen many post about keyboard issues as well!!"
B08122HHX9,FLNewGirl,5.0 out of 5 stars,My favorite laptop ever!,"Reviewed in the United States on November 1, 2020","I work from home and have a heavier Lenovo Thinkpad from work. This one is a lot more portable - around the house and when traveling. It's very responsive and quick. I use a blue marble ""skin"" on it to protect it from scratches. I am a 66 yr old educator who creates online graduate courses for a college in Chicago. I work remotely from Florida and have no problem doing my work on this Yoga. In fact, I've hardly used my work laptop since getting this one 2 mos ago. Favorite features: thin profile, screen brightness, backlit keyboard, and finger recognition for login (which works amazingly well). I've never regretted getting this laptop and highly recommend it."
B08122HHX9,Chelsea,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Laptop for College Students!!,"Reviewed in the United States on October 5, 2020","Looking for a laptop for myself, a freshmen in college, I was so scared that I would purchase the wrong laptop. I looked and compared things for weeks on end. This was the best laptop that I could have ever bought for myself. It runs great, I find no problems in it being slow. The Touch screen works great. I love that I can fold it in have and use it as a tablet if I want. Sometimes when I'm laying in bed to watch a movie I can flip the screen backwards to stand it up. The sound is also amazing on this thing! I am able to have a lot of tabs open at once for school and I have had absolutely no troubles with anything so far. The camera quality is also fantastic for those of you stuck in zoom classes. The battery also last me through at least one, if not two full days of usage. It's really nice that the charger for the computer is a US-C cable, it works perfectly with my pixel phone! If i ever need to charge anything I just switch back and forth between my computer and my phone.Although quick thing, if there are any gamers stumbling on this computer. Although, it is a very amazing computer but I seriously doubt you can run anything heavy duty on here such as a Call of Duty game, CSGO, or anything that needs a lot of ram. If you love playing minecraft though, I was able to run that very easily without no problem.Overall it is a great computer, if anything ever happens to this one I will for sure buy from this company again. Also extra brownie points for this company because it came in A WEEK EARLIER THAN IT WAS SUPPOSED TOO!! I was shocked to find it in the mail. Any college student looking for a nice computer for school, don't worry no more because this is your best option!"

B08122HHX9,Tigerlily,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great product, great price, reliable seller","Reviewed in the United States on September 2, 2020","This Lenovo Yoga is great for the price.  I bought it because of the reputation of this brand and this seller.  The laptop is crisp and reliable, gives me all I need for office use and some play.  I learned that Lenovo doesn’t allow memory expansion so I’m not sure I’d go with this brand if I were a heavy user, but it suits my needs and is fast for me.Also, I appreciate the seller who has a great satisfaction rating and gives a 30 day guarantee on their product.  Received it in less than half the time anticipated. (thanks!)"
B08122HHX9,Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great laptop for its price!,"Reviewed in the United States on August 10, 2020","I've owned this laptop for a month and so far I have to say it's an amazing product for its price (bought it at 650$). Good performance overall, I'd recomend it for students, browsing, office and streaming (youtube, netflix).Pros-Good display and color accuracy-good build quality-light weight and good lookingCons-glossy screen  (would not recomend for outdoor use, looks like a mirror)-my unit gets very hot sometimes when charger plugged inSo far no problems with wifi connections Nor screen or trackpad issues. Decent speakers and keyboard."
B08122HHX9,MIkeZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great lightweight laptop,"Reviewed in the United States on September 3, 2020","Purchased for wife who wanted slim lightweight powerful machine.  just registered with Lenovo and does not appear to be any issues with 1 year warranty.  Only thing is would like to have had 512 GB SSD, only 256 GB.Seller did great job in getting in few days and no issues with packaging.  One comment was surprised that signature was not required.  This was a good value on Amazon and seller was great."

B08122HHX9,KJ,2.0 out of 5 stars,Hinge issue,"Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2020",This series of laptops from Lenovo have hinge issues. Particularly on the left hinge. Mine came with loose LCD frame connection with the hinge.NOT the seller's fault. Seller was great. Fast shipping. Brand new laptop came in sealed box.It's a manufacturing / design issue with Lenovo Yogas.
B08122HHX9,Erika,1.0 out of 5 stars,Touch screen does NOT work,"Reviewed in the United States on September 21, 2020",If I could give this product zero stars I would. Customer service told me to purchase another laptop before they would send me another laptop is not fair. I am a full time college student that does not have an extra 7-800$ sitting around and I need my laptop hence all classes are online at this time. I have yet to hear back from customer service to resolve my complaint. I even had Lenovo technician come to my home to try to fix my laptop and he said I would need a new device. The customer service has not responded. Terrible customer service. Would NOT recommend!
B08122HHX9,Tenuem,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Failed on/off button, slow refund process","Reviewed in the United States on September 28, 2020","This is an attractive laptop with good features at a reasonable price point.  However, the laptop's on/off button failed in less than a month of ownership.  We returned this two weeks ago, but haven't heard back on our refund."
B08122HHX9,Nfansu2,1.0 out of 5 stars,Terrible laptop,"Reviewed in the United States on November 10, 2020","Just few weeks of buying this laptop, it started to have charging issues. First, it will not charge when am using it and is turn. If i plug the charger while laptop is on, the screen will flash on and off constantly. So, it only charge when am not using it and is off.  After that, it stop charging all together. Even if i turn it off, the charger will not charge the battery. It will turn on with charger connected but still will not charge. Just a waste"
B08122HHX9,Sonia,3.0 out of 5 stars,Faulty Keyboard,"Reviewed in the United States on October 6, 2020","The backspace and delete buttons are temperamental. They work sometimes and sometimes they don't. Foolishly, I was hoping the problem would clear up and did not return it within the window. I should have. I'm not sure if a problem with sticky keys is something that can be addressed with the warranty or not. I would NOT recommend it."
B08122HHX9,Saleh,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Laptop for school!,"Reviewed in the United States on November 2, 2020","With everything online this semester for school, I was looking for a good laptop for taking notes. This laptop works excellently. The touch screen is very nice and responsive and the laptop itself is lightweight and can easily be adjusted to suit your needs. For the best experience writing, I'd recommend getting a stylus, as this laptop does not come with one unless you add it on. All in all, this laptop gives you all the important features that premium ones have while also staying affordable."
B08122HHX9,Shannon,1.0 out of 5 stars,DO NOT BUY THIS DEVICE,"Reviewed in the United States on October 20, 2020","This computer was purchased for online learning this school year. It has completely stopped working and I have had to do complete reset twice. This is not even remotely okay. My eight-year-old daughter does her school work on this device and just runs a few school apps. Nothing she’s doing should crash this machine, but it keeps happening."
B08122HHX9,SREmmons,5.0 out of 5 stars,Solid convertible with very good performance,"Reviewed in the United States on August 21, 2020","I was looking for a new convertible tablet/laptop for my wife. She wanted something small-ish, light, with keyboard and touch screen. Having used only Windows computers, she also wanted Microsoft Windows. The Yoga fit bill, is inexpensive, and made my wife happy. A win on all fronts."

B08122HHX9,Dana Lorelle,3.0 out of 5 stars,"After three months, microphone is dead","Reviewed in the United States on October 25, 2020","At first I really liked this laptop. It's nice & light. But I started noticing in zoom meetings that my audio would start sounding robotic. Then, the mic stopped working altogether at around 3 months. Now, I'm having to send it off to be fixed (and yes, Lenovo is covering it), but that still means I'm without a computer for at least a week."

B08122HHX9,ALamarNC,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good alternative to Macbook Air,"Reviewed in the United States on October 11, 2020","This laptop is pretty solid and lightweight for the money, compares well to my Macbook Air which cost a few hundred more. It gets hot seemingly at random, though, and the fan can be pretty loud. My Macbook is far less prone to glitches, but I blame that on Windows, not the hardware."

B08122HHX9,lmich,1.0 out of 5 stars,Terrible wifi reception and worse support,"Reviewed in the United States on May 18, 2020","I loved this computer when I first got it, but within months realized that the slow wireless reception i was receiving was not due to my ISP deficiency but to the Lenovo computer itself (this problem is all over reviews elsewhere but somehow I missed it before purchasing).  Now we are experiencing COVID and I really need this computer to perform but. Lenovo's service, at least at this time, is very poor.  During such a time a drop in service is expected in most industries but Lenovo service is the worst I have experienced so far.It is not possible to reach a tech support person by phone, and if you request a call back it can occur any time within 48 hours and you need to be ready and available when it comes.  When I got my call back two days later I was in the car and was told i would receive another call at an appointed time that evening but the call never came.  I also tried creating a support request ticket through their website but I got a message that my product is not supported (this is a new model and a new computer).  I tried a chat support but the chat tech initially made, umm.. let's say less than logical recommendations, and then apparently got some help because the later recommendations were highly technical and involved advanced settings, as well as updating drivers, and the instructions did not match the option choices in he settings.  Desperate for a solution, I finally spent virtually all night researching this problem on Youtube and I think made some progress with part of the problem, but thought it would be a good idea to follow the tech's instruction to make sure all the recommended updates were installed.  I installed their recommended bios update and now I have no access to my docking station and all the accessories needed for an intensive work. A new cycle of bad support begins...So now my wifi reception is better, no thanks to Lenovo, but I am not looking forward to another night of research. I did not buy this from Amazon, I bought it from Best Buy but you may as well buy it from Amazon because Best Buy has no better access to support than Lenovo.  Since I value good support and do not enjoy researching this crap when I need to be sleeping, I am going back to Dell where the quality and support is excellent."
B08122HHX9,Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great laptop,"Reviewed in the United States on September 24, 2020","Very happy with the purchase.

B08122HHX9,Daniel Gontar,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent,"Reviewed in the United States on March 25, 2020","I purchased this computer around December of 2019 (not from amazon, but from Bestbuy). It has been excellent overall. I am most impressed by its memory capacity and its speed. The keyboard is very good also and allows very fast typing. The touchscreen works well, although I don't have much use for that. One drawback for me is that it didn't come with MS Word, although some sources (Bestbuy possibly) may give you this option with an extra payment. So I downloaded OpenOffice and LibreOffice. One thing which is also missing is an HDMI port, so I bought two converters, one converting from HDMI to USB C, and another for HDMI to USB 3.0 (standard). One of these will have to be purchased if you want to use HDMI.I would like to say one more thing though and it is about the ventilation of these notebook computers.  If you are using the computer on a couch and don't want to use a table in front of you, to keep adequate ventilation you should put the computer on a computer stand or on some surface which allows ventilation. (A fabric of a couch is not one of them). I use a large sketchbook and it seems to allow ventilation. If you don't allow ventilation the overheating will eventually destroy the internal components of the machine.It's an incredible bargain at 800 dollars. (I bought mine for around 1,000 at Bestbuy)."
B08122HHX9,G. Lipari,1.0 out of 5 stars,DO NOT BUY!! - Lenovo Support and Premium Care Worst in Industry,"Reviewed in the United States on October 8, 2020","DO NOT BUY!! - Lenovo Support and Premium Care Worst in IndustryLenovo Support and Premium Care Worst in Industry - DO Note Care about CustomersI bought a Lenovo Yoga C740 14"" - Mica laptop on July 20, 2020 on about Sept 1st, 2020 the screen cracked and the touchscreen no longer worked. The shutter for camera cracked when we tried to close the shutter and it cracked the screen making 3 full length cracks in the screen.I called support via chat and explained the issue they said they would give me  a replacement and they would call in 2-3 days. I week later I called back, escalated the issue and they said for sure in 2 days they would call. 3 days later called back, escalated the issue a 2nd time. Again assurance someone would call.Waited more than a week and called again! this time asking for a full refund. They said they understood and someone would call me.Waited another week, more than 1 month as passed now with cracked screen. I called support on the phone spent 45 mins on the line being transfered and put on hold to finally get hung up on.I called premium support and again they said they will escalate and someone will call. I asked for supervisor or manager. Waited 10 mins only to tell me they are busy! They would call me. I asked for an exact time and they did not want to give it. Finally had no choice but to wait again.Laptop was bought for my son to do his school work now with a cracked screen which can cut him. I cannot get a refund, replacement or anything. Cannot buy a new one until I get a refund as I cannot afford to buy 2 laptops!!!We are screwed and no one at lenovo wants to help, cares to help or i suspect is even able to help. This is by far the worse support and premium care I have ever experience in my lifetime. They build bad laptops then make it impossible to get it fixed, replaced or get a refund!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

B08122HHX9,Jhonathan Rodriguez,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for Back To School during online only classes,"Reviewed in the United States on August 27, 2020","I have always been a Lenovo fan but my wife on the other had has always had Dell. I hoped to convert her with this Laptop and she loves it. First of all the build quality is amazing since it has an all aluminum body which feels very premium. The screen is awesome at 1080p but do recommend getting a screen protector if you will be using touch since it is glossy and will get finger prints. The one I used was ""Spigen Tempered Glass Screen Protector Designed for Asus Chromebook Flip C434TA"" on amazon which fit it perfectly after reading about someone doing the same.The speakers on this laptop are amazing with Dolby Audio I was amazed at what I was actually hearing! Keyboard is nice and comfortable to type on with feedback just so satisficing. Pairing with Lenovo Active Pen 2 which I bought from amazon really adds value to this laptop when writing notes.If your looking for a mid-range laptop than I really recommend it. 14in is good for someone who wants something light and portable to take from desk to bed.Recommend to anyone"
