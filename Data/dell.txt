The laptop is gorgeous but beware of the touchpad as it wobbles and has like a false click when youre using it; this is by now a known issue and my unit was affected by it. Im evaluating my replacement options right now, but it seems its hard to get a unit without this or worse issues. Update1: Dell wants to replace the part with an on-site technician visit but they are backordered. Will update this review if this works. Update2: Almost 30 days after purchase and 20 days since contacting support Dell has not scheduled the technician visit as the order is backordered. Beware when buying this laptop, a lot of them present this issue. Update3: I have received 3 units of this laptop so far (two replacements). The QA is bad, they all had touchpad or screen issues, the latest one having flex to click issues (google flex to click apes 9500). BTW the technician visit on update2 was never scheduled and the ETA was moved up twice. If youre picky with touchpads or quality of your purchases dont buy this model. Reducing my review to one star.
Get the package today 08/01/2020. The box already broken and the device not brand new in box, it seems like open box item. Not happy with the purchase. Have requested return.
I was a little nervous reading reviews that stated that computers come used, not working etc. I can confirm that Amazon delivered to me a pristine machine - working perfectly, is new and exactly to the spec Amazon advertised. Very happy with the purchase. I purchased UHD Touchscreen 10th gen i7 - the screen is perfect, on par or better than new MacBook Pro that I also use. Overall new XPS 15 is well designed, solid machine with fast processor and outstanding UHD screen. I also like that I can upgrade it to 64GB or RAM for about $300 (2933MHz DDR4 CL17 SODIMM Laptop Memory). P.S. For non-technical people, please run both Dell updater (lots of drivers / bios updates there) and Windows updates.
This laptop is fantastic, and overall, I am very satisfied with this purchase.  But lets talk about the elephant in the room that a few reviewers have already pointed out: Is this a new product?  Given the $2000 price tag, its only natural to be concerned about the integrity of the product you are receiving.  I understand that entirely as I was very concerned myself. For me, the laptop itself was inside its original packaging and showed no signs of being opened before.  With that said, the box was a little banged up upon arrival.  The laptop itself was wrapped around plastic, and everything inside seemed in place. Now, there is a shipping label on the original packaging box from Dell Returns located in Lebanon, Tennessee.  So, I did some quick investigating.  I read that most returns for Dell products will get shipped to this Return Center in Lebanon, Tennessee.  These returns include order cancellations and unopened returns.  Dell Outlet, in turn, sells these new unused products at a cheaper price tag.  So yes, I believe this product is NEW, but it is new under the Dell Outlet standards.  This is just my assumption but is the most logical reason I can think of. For me, I have no problem receiving a Dell Outlet product, but it should at least be advertised as such on Amazon.  Now, considering all these factors and even if this is a Dell Outlet product, getting a Dell XPS 15 (2020 model) at this price (~$2000) is a STEAL!  You are getting Dells UHD touchscreen infinity display, latest i7 CPU, 1 TB of SSD storage, and Windows 10 Pro.  If you were buying this same laptop configuration off Dells official website, it run you close to ~$2500.  On top of the cheaper price tag on Amazon, there is a 10% back for customers who purchase this laptop on an Amazon Prime Visa card (~$200 back).The laptop itself has solid specs and is built very solidly.  The aluminum casing and carbon fiber finish gives this laptop a premium feel.  The display is gorgeous and crisp.  The touchscreen is super responsive.  The track pad is honestly the best I have experienced on any Windows laptop.  I personally have NOT had the wobbly track pad issue some users were having. Some issues I do have with the laptop is that it does heat up quite a bit, and you can hear the fans spinning hard at times. Dell has a weird adaptive brightness feature, but you can easily turn this off in the settings.  Battery life is less than impressive when you are doing more intensive tasks.  I hear the pre-installed McAfee software plays a role in draining the battery, so you could disable it and use the built-in Windows Defender.  And while I love the carbon fiber finish (because it gives it an even more premium feel), it is a fingerprint magnet lol. All in all, this laptop is stunning.  The amount of features you receive for the price that you buy this laptop at outweighs the minor issues that I have pointed out.
I was very excited to receive this laptop. It was a total disappointment. When I started, there was a squeaking fan noise. The noise is good enough to annoy. Then the keyboard is too warm to feel you uncomfortable. I called customer care. They asked me to upgrade bios. After upgrading, fan noise reduced, and squeaky noise vanished. However, keyboard was too warm. Even after cooling down, when I try to open, it gives the uncomfortable heat to the keyboard. Why do you even sell a laptop with bios not upgraded and defects? Return service also disappointing. I returned in Aug 6 (on the same day I received). As of Aug 14, I havent received. customer service told; it will take 2 more weeks to refund. Bad experience. I will never buy a laptop in Amazon. It would have been easier on a local BestBuy
Battery is outstanding if you compare to any product of this size. I know specs and read reviews but let me tell you this is your go to laptop for mobility, performance, and work. Lets be clear... no graphics card. 1080p screen.... and crunched space is noticeable. (WHAT WOULD YOU EXPECT FROM A LAPTOP THAT IS 8x11) If you care about screen bleeding... my question is how you want a bright screen and 1/4 screen frame? If you care about keyboard space, then you are better off with bigger products. This product is made to perform... that is not compromised. Fast Wi-Fi___33, fast processor, fast ram. If this makes you happy... look no further
I bought this laptop for music storage, social media, surfing, and storage and editing photography.  I dont do any graphic intensive games, so no comment there. GOOD: I do like the screen size and image quality, touch screen, storage, RAM, keyboard, SSD startup times, backlit keyboard, and slim design.  I think the price is consistent with those features.  It set up easily.  Its slim.  It seems quick.  If not listed below, I suppose Im happy with it. BAD: - Screen brightness change.  This freaked me out until I went online and found how to disable the adaptive screen.  I need a consistent accurate screen editing my pics.  Even disabled, I still see a brightness change slightly after I load an image.  Ive done two support chats with mixed experiences.  Ill forward and check the images to see if my editing is accurate.  If so, I suppose I can live with the pause. - Oven.  I use the laptop in my lap.  I can hardly use it plugged in due to the heat.  It needs better cooling.  Looking online, this seems to be a Dell design issue on some models.  The solution list, other than keeping it lint free, are all about non-lap surfaces and maybe cooling pads.  Um.  No.- Ports.  While its a little nice to be able to charge from either side, these little ports basically work with no USB/HDMI/SD without adapters.  There are 2 little ports that can charge or use an included adapter to USB.  Theres a micro SD that fits none of my existing camera SD cards.  If Im charging and cooking my lap, I can use the USB adapter for one accessory.  Very limiting and adapters are an expensive hassle to my exiting blue-toothless devices. On balance, for the money, I would say the features balanced by issues makes it OK.  I cant compare it to competition, but Id say if you use it for long in your lap for photography editing. and you have full size SD cards. check out the competition.
After updating the recommended audio driver from dell site, audio no longer worked. After 45 minutes of handing the system over to dell tech support, computer was bricked! Sorry for the inconvenience was their response. Really? I wont be replacing this one with a dell computer.PS Dell, why dont you hire Americans for work from home technical support?
I am a heavy user, multitasking most of the time with applications and screens. Wanted a compact laptop with high RAM, found this. I am very happy with the performance, the battery... Only wished it to have some more USB sockets and provision for sim card onboard. Overall a very good and elegant product.
Dell XPS 15 9500This is a magnificent 15.6 in laptop created for the creative professional. It is capable of gaming but does not accel in that field. The version I selected has the following hardware:- i7 10750H- GTX 1650 it- 16GB RAM- 1TB SSD-86 Whir battery (good for 8-9 hours of normal internet surfing)Appearance:-The dimensions of this laptop are: H= .71 (18mm) W= 13.57 (344.72mm) D= 9.06 (230.14mm). It is 4.5 lbs. (2.05 kg). -The chassis is made of CNC aluminum. The dell logo in the center of the lid is glossy. -The palm wrest is a soft black carbon fiber with a touchpad is which is like that of a MacBook. Display-The laptop has a 16:10 infinity-edge display. This means that where are almost no bezels on this screen at all. My model has a 3840x2400 screen with VESA certifiedHDR400 sporting a 500nit display. It has 100% Adobe RGB and 94% DCI-P3 color gamut so finishing quickly: Features:-Windows hello (facial recognition)-Finger print scanner-720p camera on top of display-nice IO with 2 thunderbolt 3 ports on the left along with a Kensington lock slot and on the right a USB-C with charging capabilities, a headphone jack and a SD card slot on the right.-The laptop comes with an adapter allowing you to use an HDMI or USB-type A device.-laptop has Wi-Fi___33 and Bluetooth connectivity***Note***-The first batch of this product had a touchpad wobble that may also click unintentionally. Mine did not have this issue. -The McAfee free antivirus that comes with the computer greatly increases the drain of battery life. I recommend removal.
DONT PUT IT ON YOUR LAP WHILE CHARGING. When plugged in the laptop becomes one step away from a fire hazard.  It gets extremely hot. To the point I wont leave it plugged overnight not open and near a fan. Other than that, its a nice computer. Runs great for photo editing, not for gaming. Tends to crash even with early 2000 games, especially when plugged in when it Will overheat.
Im an IT guy so having a machine that is powerful but agile is important to me.  I upped the RAM to 32Gb of DDR4-2933.  Since it does not do XMP, DDR4-3200 will not run full speed.  But thats OK by me, it performs great.  Im glad I waited for the Windows Hello camera built in.  Make sure you have USB-C devices or adapters for other peripherals.  It does come with one adapter also.  You wont go wrong with this laptop.
Love this laptop! Fast, great touchscreen and lightweight. Could use more than two ports but beyond that its great.
Overall, I am very happy with my Dell XPS 13 9300. The trackpad and touchscreen have excellent sensitivity, the webcam and keyboard are of much higher quality than my previous laptop (admittedly, a much cheaper Lenovo Idea pad) and the screen resolution and color reproduction, while not world-beating, are more than adequate for all but artists and graphic designers. Having 16gb of RAM has made a huge difference in running multiple browser tabs. As a middle school teacher working remotely, I need at least 20 tabs running simultaneously to teach a class online, several with videos queued up. Gone are the awkward delays and freeze-ups that would sometimes plague my previous 8gb machine. I should certainly mention that my XPS 13 stopped working entirely after 8 days - so why the four-star review? I couldnt have been more impressed with both Dell and Amazon customer service; the prompt return calls, careful attention, allowing me plenty of options (repair or replacement) and ultimately replacing my laptop the very next day. Its a fact of life that complex machines can break; its what happens after that in my opinion is most important. So, why not five stars? This new computer comes with the latest version of Windows 10, which is far more intrusive than Ive experienced before. For example, there is no way to stop Cortana spying on you, disengaging Skype has become much harder, and installing the latest Dell drivers was made more challenging, in part because of changes to Windows firewall and bios. Specifically, it took almost two days of troubleshooting to diagnose and remedy an issue with the speaker driver - during which I was without sound. Nevertheless, my overall impressions have been very favorable and wholeheartedly recommend this laptop.
This is a great laptop for students. I am an engineering student, and I wanted a Windows laptop because iOS cant run some of the programs I am using. This laptop provides that and much more. I am incredibly impressed by the battery life. I recommend. Also, I was kind of hesitant in buying a laptop from Amazon, but it arrived fast and in great condition.
I was looking to get a high-end machine like this one for long time, its a slim, classy, and super cool laptop. Small, great for traveling, super expensive. Why provide a charger that cannot last more than 6 months, I am typing this review on a 3 year old machine from their biggest competitor, 4 times less expensive laptop, the original charger my of this model just died due to extreme traveling and the wire broker, so this new one 45 W super good looking charger cant last at least 6 months. Amazon is doing their best, they are online with me and the company appears to be inclined to ship a new adaptor, I am on call for 31 minutes...Amazon customer service is on the call, their service 10. Factory just rambling...and transfer call around...I purchase the extended warranty from Amazon so I now it will take care eventually, glad I kept the old laptop, and since most of my work is inside Dropbox, until Dell sends the replacement charger under warranty, I am not dead in the water. BUYER BEWARE!!!!
I rarely take the time to write reviews, but this is a big-ticket item for most people. I have nothing bad to say regarding the particular XPS 9500 unit I received with a couple of caveats...The Bad: Similar to other reviewers, I suspect this product is not NEW as described but rather returned and/or refurbished. It came in a rather torn up box which was simply sealed with regular packing tape. It was shipped to Amazon from a company that appears to be an authorized reseller/or refurbishing center as far as I could tell from a quick Google search. The box had certainly been around the block a time or two, Olivine the price point and specs, Im not surprised if it is a refurb, open box, return, etc. Im only surprised that Amazon sells them at a steep discount but describes as NEW. I could be way off base here, and perhaps Dell ships most of their products in beat up boxes, and Im just unaware of it. The Good: I know the above sounded very critical but bear with me. Once I opened the outer box, the inner Dell box was pristine. Everything was nicely packaged and appeared brand new. The usual protective plastic peel off, unwrap, etc. stuff was all there on everything. There wasnt a fingerprint or speck of dust to be found.  Even smelled like new. So... I figured Id give it a go. Set it up and everything seemed fine, so I opened it up and upgraded memory to 64gb. Everything internally looked new to my untrained eye as well.  Ive been using it for several days with no issues. Overall, I personally am happy for the price, but if these arent truly new, I think description should reflect that. Considerations: My laptop before this one was an XPS 15 2012 or 2013 model. It originally had Windows 8 on its FWIW. I had upgraded to SSD, switched to Win10, maxed out RAM, and replaced battery over the years...Just so you know my basis for comparison. Other reviews on both Amazon and online mention crackling speakers and faulty trackpads with this model.  My experience has been that speakers sound as good as any laptop Ive ever heard, and trackpad is slightly less sensitive in top corners but otherwise fine (I never would have noticed trackpad thing except for online reviews had me looking for faults.) I personally find the speakers and trackpad perfectly fine. Another criticism has been loud fan noise when laptop is trying to cool.  It doesnt bother me because my old XPS sounds like a turbo spooling up when its under a load too! Maybe other brands are quieter, IDK. Fan noise wasnt a big concern of mine. Perhaps mine was a return/refurb that had faults addressed, I just got lucky and got a good unit, or the faults arent as bad as they are made out to be with this model. I cant say for certain, but thats my experience thus far and honest review.
Ive included the laptop configuration to be sure. I saw one review unrelated to this specific laptop in the mix. New Dell XPS 15 9500 15.6 inch UHD Touchscreen Laptop (Silver) Intel Core i7-10750H 10th Gen, 16GB DDR4 RAM, 1TB SSD, Nvidia GTX 1650 It with 4GB GDDR6, Window 10 Pro (XPS9500-7845SLV-PUS)I received my laptop on 10/1. But I was too nervous about opening the package after having read several negative reviews about the trackpad. Finally, I opened the box a few days later because I was curious to see what I had bought. Like in several other reports, the first thing I noticed was the Dell returns label. So that was the first red flag. And just for that, I was ready to seal the box and send it back. But then I decided to check out the trackpad. If it turned out to be okay, then I would keep the machine. After powering on the laptop, I tested the trackpad in every way possible by pressing and clicking. I wanted to know if I would get the wobble or rattle effect that others have experienced. I didnt. But as I tested out the trackpad, I noticed something else--the erratic cursor movement. No matter how hard I tried moving the cursor, it had a mind of its own. It would not go in the directions I wanted. So, I quickly Googled and found that it was also another issue other have reported. One even mentioned Dell sending a technician to replace the trackpad. I dont have an issue buying a refurbished laptop, given that the seller had stated in the descriptions clearly. But Dell wasnt willing to do that, of course. They needed to rid as many of the problematic units as possible. I knew the price was too low to be true. I had even compared it with the same configuration on Dells website. Too bad. The laptop even got the thumbs up from many YouTube reviewers as one of the top-notch video editing computers. I didnt have the time to look for other potential flaws. So, I packaged it the same day and sent it back. I finally received my refund nearly three weeks later. Not sure why it took that long to process. I vaguely remember someone else mentioning the slow refund as well. Dell has lost my confidence in buying their laptops online. So off to the other reputable sellers I go!
Spectacular! Arrived in perfect state. Its beautiful. Works perfectly and I love it. Best Ultrabook ever. The touchscreen sometimes stops working but only happened twice had to reboot or disable the device but still works perfectly well when working, smooth beautiful resolution. Responsive. Light. Super-fast. Amazing design. I cant think of a better laptop. I only missed not getting the pen. Really need that. The Touchpad and keypad are smooth and comfortable. Its just amazing. Overall, the perfect Ultrabook.
I bought the XPS 13 9300 touchscreen. I wanted to go big because everyone reviewed how this Ultrabook was the best in 2020. The laptop was great. It was very light and compact. I use it for my college classes and watch my daily videos. One day, I suddenly I get 7 white flashes and 2 amber flashes that constantly repeated on the laptops battery source. I restarted the laptop and my display does not work (pitch black). However, it does work when you connect it to an external display. I did a lot of research and tried to fix the software, but apparently the LCD gave out on me. I was very disappointed, especially since this Ultrabook was not cheap.
I dont normally write reviews, but I just wanted to report that this machine came in perfect. No touchpad issues, nothing negative whatsoever. I am highly critical of laptops, being a cloud architect. I can detect absolutely nothing wrong with this piece. I was highly concerned that the touchpad would wobble etc. but nope, perfect. Its the first touchpad Ive ever used that rivals a MacBook. Its big enough to perform the three and four-finger gestures that are now built into windows 10. Touchscreen is sublime. Keyboard: no complaints. Its just great all around.
The product was supplied with a label indicating it had gone from Dell returns dept to Amazon and didnt appear to be original packaging. It is clearly not a brand-new machine. The box itself looked like it had been kicked around the warehouse a bit. It went straight back.
Well I will hate to admit it, but the previous comment regarding the track pad is still an issue. While using the track pad, it feels unnatural and wobblily, and I willing to bet it will get you upset.
The best laptop I ever purchased.
after only 3 months it didnt turn on again. call dell more than 7 times very very bad experience, I am very busy to buy a 1.7k laptop to find out that there is a problem in only months. Second dell apes with problems, if you want a computer that last this is not the one. Dell needs to step up a give to client a better customer service, a had to call 8 times only for them to realize that they need to replace the motherboard of a new laptop
The title says it all.  There is only one USB port and it stopped working at all after one month.  Nothing I do has any effect on it.  Its useless.
the laptop heats up with minimal effort. The processor stops constantly, and the sound came defective.
This laptop is light and easy to use.  Setup was a snap and there was very little bloatware that I had to remove from the system.  The keyboard backlighting is a little dim for my eyes, but the screen is clear and easy to read.
I didnt know the webcam was so bad. Very disappointed with that
I have a 2018 Dell XPS 13 that has been unreliable.  So, I was nervous to trust Dell again.  But after a few months of using this device I find it to be rock solid. Driver and BIOS updates are constantly being pushed (feels like daily) so Im sure Dell is working out kinks I havent found. But overall, Im impressed. Pros:-Light, small footprint, but still a large display-Can be obtained without annoying touch screen!-Support for MS Hello is an unexpected pleasure-Great keyboard for old-school touch typists!-Blazing Fast-Support 32GB of RAM for Mac :-Weak graphics (you wont be playing games on this laptop)-USB-C only, but its the new world-Its so darned pretty I worry it will get stolen? I havent experienced the heat others have, then again, I dont sit it on my lap much.  The fans do run a lot, but they are very quiet IMO. The only disappointment is the graphics. Reviews implied you could do basic gaming using Intel Iris.  I havent found that to be true.  But the fact I can run two VMs simultaneously and still be productive on my main OS, makes this an ultra-mobile powerhouse for me. Its why the seeming regression in CPU isnt listed as a con.  And in the end, this is a work machine, not a gaming rig. I cant comment on battery life yet.
Purchase a highly rated Dell 2-1.  Discover that Dell charges extra for interface to adapt USB devices.  Thunderbolt 3 on top of $1800. Computer.
I have noticed my touch pad has a click sound to it when just moving the courser, it gives a fake  sound of a click, especially on the right side of the touch pad, it is really an annoying feeling to get on a 2000$ laptop, please fix this issue
I turned it on, and it ran. Pretty dope honestly.
Paid full price and received a beat-up box from Dell Returns.  Obviously not a new machine. NOT advertised as open box.
This is not brand-new laptop Dell returns label intact on the box Build quality and screen resolution is outstanding perfect laptop for gaming and watching 4K videos
The display blows me away.  Plenty of CPU and memory and a large SSD.
A gorgeous laptop with a nice screen and no Trackpad issue. However, the fan noise goes load when processing Spyder and that didnt happen in my old laptop which were bought 2years ago.
You dont have to charge the computer every day because the battery life is long.
My comment is that this machine heats up too much. The fans are loud and go out of control.
Easy to use and very powerful
Great Computer. Punching above its weight. Use it for business and travel.
The laptop was faulty with constant screen flickering, despite updating to the latest drivers/Windows updates/BIOS, etc. There was no damage to the packaging or the laptop itself.
Overall, pretty good computer!
As other people have reported, this product arrived in a generic box with a Dell Returns shipping label attached. This is not a new device as advertised.
Great choice
In less than 3 weeks the touch screen failed, and Dell repair efforts are painful to connect with and get the product warranty executed.
Overall, this is a high performance 2-in-1 laptop/tablet with some impressive features. It is fashioned from a single piece of aluminum which creates a solid quality feel.  The high definition Gorilla glass display is also a response touchscreen--and the very thin border increases actual screen-size. Performance is lightning fast and reliable. It is quiet while operating and remains cool.  Using Wi-Fi 6 means a faster wireless speed which I noticed when transferring files over my network and running software remotely.  And, when connected to a compatible external drive the Thunderbolt 3 ports provide impressively quick access. The laptop/tablet is close to perfect but there are a couple minor items that could be better.  For example, it only has two USB C ports one of which is usually required for power (the battery fully charged lasts approximately 4 hours) which leaves only one open port for a peripheral device. A Thunderbolt 3 hub may be a wise choice to optimize the machines top performance. Finally, setting up the fingerprint sensor is the usual tedious process, but I found performance inconsistent, so I end up using another login option.  Otherwise this is an elegant easy-to-use, high-performance machine. If interested details are noted below. Setup. It arrived fully charged and when opened t began the Windows 10 Home Edition voice-based installation requesting things like language, location, Wi-Fi name and password. If already possessing a Windows account, it uses previously established settings. Otherwise an account will need to be set up or bypassed by setting up a local user. Be aware that it will automatically install a third-party security program on a free three-month trial basis unless the option is unchecked. And even though I unchecked the option the prompt appeared with every restart until I uninstalled it in Windows. Other trial software automatically installed includes Office 365, Netflix, Dropbox, Candy Crush and Farm Heroes Saga--the user can decide whether to uninstall. After the Windows setup is complete the Dell setup begins which strongly recommended the installation of 9 updated drivers. I had to re-run it three times and it periodically re-booted during the process.  This is part of a Dell suite of included software that automatically updates software and drivers on the machine unless the user opts out. Other parts of the suite include a Power Manager, a Mobile Connect which allows access to a smartphone, Cinema Guide for subscribing to screening services and Digital Delivery for ordering s wide range of software like Microsoft Office. The HD webcam built into the top edge of the bezel is so small the standard webcam covers I have on-hand are all too big. The webcam has a white LED indicator light, so it is obvious when in use. The keyboard has large keys, no numeric keypad and it is subtly back-lit. In addition to the two Thunderbolt 3 ports the laptop/tablet has a 3.5mm headphone port and a SD micro slot. Included is a USB C to USB A adapter and a two-piece USB C AC adapter.
UPDATE: October 4, 2020 - It took Dell 2 moths, but they have replaced my XPS 9500 with a new unit. A week later and I havent had a hardware failure. In fact, this machine runs great. The battery life is still bad at less than 4 hours under low usage including web browser, and stuff like Word, and a little photoshop, with screen brightness at about 60%. Having that gorgeous 4K screen comes with a price. So overall this is a very nice laptop that wants to compete with Apple. The differences are that a MacBook is going to provide superior battery life and customer service. Still, if you need a good Windows 10 laptop for graphics work, this is a pretty good. Provided it doesnt start breaking the day after you take it out of the box. UPDATE: September 12, 2020 - Over a month after receiving the XPS 9500, this laptop still is not working correctly. Since having the sound daughterboard, and then the entire motherboard and the upper deck to fix a touchpad wobble problem, the Bluetooth does not work, and the wireless is so weak I have to be a few feet from a wireless router. The last tech said that the antenna was probably damaged when the first tech worked on the laptop.3 weeks ago I requested that Dell replace the laptop since its obviously a lemon. They have done nothing but give me the runaround since. I took another star off because this laptop is not worth the price or the hassle. Im disappointed with Dell and their support. UPDATE: August 20, 2020 - The Dell XPS 9500 saga continues. 2 weeks after reporting a sound hardware failure, Dell sent a tech out to replace sound daughter board and touchpad since the touchpad it shipped with wobbled, double clicked instead of single clicked, and there was a 1 dead space down the center. The tech spent an hour taking the laptop apart and putting the new parts in. The fix didnt work. The tech said it was because the sound amplifier was probably dead, so he ordered a new motherboard. At this point, theres no denying that this laptop is a lemon. I called Dell to see if they would replace the laptop. I was transferred between departments 3 or 4 times, and finally reached someone in warranty support. I had to jump through a lot of hoops, including sending a picture of the back of the laptop and power supply with the serial numbers showing, and the support number, plus my name and date. So weird. The request must go to yet another department to determine if they will flat out replace the laptop with a new one. If approved they will send it in 15 to 30 days. I have had this machine for 3 weeks and it worked perfectly for 2 of those days. OH. The tech screwed up the Bluetooth antenna so now I cant connect BT headphones at all. Original Review: BOTTOM LINE: Sound died 2 days after arriving because of a hardware failure. Touchpad is a mess. It wobbles, double clicks, and sometimes gets stuck in only right click mode. This is an awfully expensive laptop with too many issues to qualify for a recommendation.IN THE BOX: The laptop arrived in a large black box that had been doubled taped - Im not sure if it was opened and closed again. The laptop itself was in a plastic wrap that was on wrong, so when I grasped the piece to lift the laptop, it instead opened, and the laptop fell back into the box. I suspect this was a repackaged laptop, however; the laptop looked flawless. It booted as soon as I opened the lid and didnt have to be plugged in for initial boot like most Windows 10 laptops. I dont know for sure if this is a used and repackaged laptop, but from other experiences, I suspect it was. OPERATION: Initially, I was blown away by the laptop except for the touchpad. The screen is stunning. At 4K, its one of the sharpest laptop screens Ive ever seen. Ive used MacBook Pros for years, so this isnt exactly a recent phenomenon, just one that is new to me on windows 10 laptop. The specs are solid with a core i7, 16 gigs of ram and a fast 1 TB SSD drive. I installed a second SSD drive and for 2 days the laptop ran like a dream with one exception. It comes with Windows 10 Pro, and while there is some bloatware, I was able to remove most of it, including McAfee, without issue. Battery life is okay. In real world use, that is with screen brightness at about 65%, and performance set to better battery I get between 3 and 5 hours of use. Doing anything that taxes the laptop can drop that to 2 hours. I loaded Europa Universalis 4, and it lasted for about an hour and a half. If you need this for business use and were hoping to get something close to 8 hours, you need to look for a different laptop. There isnt anything out there like a MacBook touchpad. Its large, responsive, and you can easily use it like a mouse. Dell has the large part down, but the touchpad has a weird double click issue, it wobbles, and sometimes it gets stuck in a weird mode where I cant scroll without the cursor zipping all over the screen, and every attempt to touch the pad results in the equivalent of a right click. Less than 48 hours after the laptop arrived the sound died, and I got a red X next to the speaker icon on the task bar. Having spent 20 years in IT, I thought I would be able to fix it with drivers. After a day of attempting to fix the issue that included restoring the laptop to factory via a fresh Windows 10 reinstall, it still wouldnt work. 2 hours on the phone with Dell support resulted in them letting me know that a tech would be dispatched to my home within one business day with a new touchpad and data board. Cool. I can deal with that. Three days later I still have not heard anything from Dell so I called support and asked when the tech would arrive. I was then informed that the parts were back ordered, and it would be a month before they could fix the laptop. Frustrating. Ive stopped using this laptop until it can be serviced, because I dont trust it for anything of a professional nature since I dont trust it not to break again. I was in the middle of writing this review when the touchpad flaked again, and I had to restart. The laptop does have a gorgeous display, and its touchscreen, but I wonder who uses a touch screen on a device like this. The display is so sharp every time I touch it, I have the urge to break out the polishing cloth and clean away fingerprints. You can have the best hardware specs in the world, but if the computer doesnt work, whats the point in purchasing it? Ill update the review once its been serviced and Ive had a chance to give it a few weeks of real-world use. For now, I recommend looking elsewhere for a laptop. Frankly, the Acer 2 in 1 Ive been using for the last 5 weeks is half the price of this laptop, works wonderfully, and I can do 8 hours of work without a single issue.
The Dell XPS 13 with the MacBook Air are the standards for Ultrabook excellence.  My work laptop is this, and I appreciate the thin design, the fast processing, and the battery life.  This laptop has a touchscreen which does drain the battery, but this is notably faster and better put together than most. The onboard interfaces are excellent with a tactile feedback and lighted keyboard and responsive trackpad.  The camera in this version is front center (not the old nostril camera in the older models).  The bezel is extremely thin with good screen real estate and brightness.  The touchscreen works with both hands and light gloves and has a very good precise pointer placement if you use a stylus.  The speakers are passable, but it still retains a legacy 3.5 aux port.  This is charged with a USB-C and the chargers are smart and work with the Dell Power Manager system to extend battery life. Even using Dell Power Manager, this iteration does not get more than 9 hours under normal use which is beneath the usual 14 hours of the non-touch versions.  I have fully charged and discharged the battery daily for about three weeks and that is the overall average (the low was 4.5 hours under heavy video play and 12 hours idle with Dell Adaptive on).  This is much less than the non-touch screen Dell XPS 13, and I wonder if this is a combination of a battery and motherboard coordination issue.  Whatever the case, the battery life in this version is beneath the normal standard compared with my own work laptop but still more than a usual workday. I would highly recommend this laptop if you must have a touchscreen with your Ultrabook, but if you do not need a touchscreen, I recommend you get the standard XPS 13 for another 8 hours of battery life.
PACKAGING: Very giftable. This computer comes in a beautiful sturdy black box with a magnetic closure. The box looks like it was designed for expensive jewelry.  If you are looking for a graduation gift, this would be very nice. SIZE: This laptop is as small as it is advertised to be. WEIGHT: Heavier than you would expect. Not so heavy that it is a burden to carry, but heavy enough so that you can feel it is durable. DISPLAY/WEBCAM: Awesome display! Love it! Great for video calls, movies, web-surfing, etc... SPEAKERS: Impressive for the size of the device. SPEED/POWER: Not so great for video games, but plenty for everything else. KEYBOARD: Too small. The keyboard is as big as it can be given the laptops small size, but too small if you must type a lot. MOUSEPAD: Good size, works fine. TOUCHSCREEN: Good response time. Touching the screen does leave fingerprints but you dont see them until they are bad. PORTS: 2 USB-C ports, a microSD card read and a 3.5mm Headphone/Microphone Combo Jack. Some more ports would be nice. ACCESSORIES NEEDED: For streaming, I had to get a USB-C to HDMI cable. Then I got a BT mouse and keyboard. I recommend BT accessories when you can get them, so you wont need to use as many USB-C ports. Basically, anything you want to do, you will need a USB-C to <whatever> converter to do it. If you dont have Wi-Fi___33, get a USB-C to Ethernet, etc... This does include a USB-C to USB cable. Overall, this is a great little laptop. Dell squeezed a lot in this small package, and it wasnt full of bloatware either - another bonus. This is going to be our streaming laptop at home and our travel laptop when we travel.
The features it has was as if it was personalized just for me. A very calm voice took me through the process of things that Dell knew I was going to need help on with setups in different categories. Its a very solid device and has been engineered for multiple ways to use it. The frame is made from a solid piece of lightweight aluminum metal with everything else attached to it. It looks and feels solid in my hands and when opening and closing the laptop the resistance is just enough. Its not too easy or hard, its just right in the sweet spot that makes it flow. The keys are fluid and respond to my touch, and Ive not had to backtrack because a key didnt respond when I touched it while writing text. The keys are backlit for evenings and I can and already have used it propped up in bed. The adjustable light for the thirteen-point four-inch screen makes it so I can avoid disturbing my better half right next to me. Its quiet enough that its fans can be heard but are just not enough to start annoying someone and waking them up. The machine flies through tasks at a very modest speed and having multiple apps open dont faze it one bit. The drawing app that I (With no fuss at all) installed whisks through tasks at blinding speed that my older laptop wished it could. What a difference in a few years of what technology can do. So far, Im impressed with every aspect of this well made and consistently reliable laptop, but I know I have only scratched the surface of its awesome power and capabilities. I will be updating for sure because as I always say time will tell the tale on quality and longevity of an item. Five Stars
Theres several technical reviews out there on this laptop that you can find on Wired, C/Net, and other techie magazines or whatever so I wont bore you or bother with technical aspects and just drop some pros and cons on this thing. First, I like the size. Its not a dinky 11.6-inch Chromebook but its not a massive 15incher either. I do find myself hitting the wrong button as I type and fumble-farting for the backspace key every now and then as the keyboard does feel a little small, but thats just a personal preference. The touch screen is awesome, and I seriously never want to use a non-touchscreen laptop ever again. Its so much faster just to bop the screen or scroll with my finger like you would on a phone or tablet than to finagle the mouse over to the side-bar, click and hold the touchpad down as I slide my finger... it just feels slow and counterproductive now. Ive had a few hiccups with the touch screen, but I honestly think it was a Windows issue and not a hardware issue. In fact, I think all my annoyances with this laptop all stem from the Windows 10 OS. I will say, though that the 2-in-1 feature is a lame gimmick. That goes for all laptops that are this way though - (again, just my opinion here) - Flipping the screen over isnt an issue - and the tablet mode kicks right in as it should and disables the keyboard, but its so freaking awkward to hold onto it when you feel all the keys depressing under your hand - I feel like Im going to snap all of them off or damage it somehow. And then just the weight and size alone make it feel awkward, too. Its just too cumbersome. I love the touchscreen, but I wont ever use it in tablet mode. I do like that it flexes around though, so if my 3-year-old gets a hold of it and folds the screen all the way around, it wont snap it or break wires inside or anything. The build quality of it is great too - but I mean, you get what you pay for, so it better be at the price point for this thing! The only issue I have with the body, which some other reviewers have mentioned, is that its hard to open the lid/screen. Its got this weird over-bite thing going on to where it over hangs the lower half/keyboard by like a quarter inch or so.  That doesnt sound bad, but the leading edge is tapered so when you hold it, you dont have anything to grab to pull the two halves apart. That probably doesnt make much sense, but I will just say its awkward and clumsy feeling just opening the thing up. The specs are amazing, but I cant take full advantage of the core i7 because my internet sucks so any lag in processing is likely from that and not the CPU. I havent loaded anything graphics-heavy like photoshop or anything onto this yet, but I will soon... The screen is crisp and bright and Im really liking this laptop so far. As a side note, my I.T. nerd at work says to go with Dell and Asus when it comes to laptops - he says the build quality and components are better.  I also like that Dell is a US based company and mainly builds their computers in Texas and Ireland.
Ive used Dell products for several years and have trusted them for the quality. But that changed with this laptop. First, it took forever to charge out of the box. The charger is alright, but its perplexing as to why it doesnt tell you when the laptop is fully charged. What is the purpose of the light on the tip then? But the main issue is the system itself. I wanted this laptop to use for a new job. Despite having a nice Dell desktop pc and a 15-inch Dell laptop, I wanted to use the 9300 just for the new job, nothing else. So, when I used a video conferencing app, the screen suddenly went berserk. I posted a photo and it stayed like that for the entire call. I could still hear people talking and all, but I was afraid to shut the laptop down, since it was my first day and it would raise eyebrows if I suddenly left the call/meeting. During all this, the laptop itself was extremely hot. It seems to have a poor (or nonexistent) cooling system. After the meeting ended, I restarted the laptop and updated everything (BIOs, firmware, etc.). And despite doing so, the screen went berserk again during the second video call/meeting. But after holding the power button, the screen returned to normal. The system was still overheating though. So, after it happened twice, I stopped using the video function on the video conferencing app and had to join the meetings with audio only. I updated the system with whatever Dell released through Support Assist but am hesitant to use the laptop.  Extremely disappointed with Dell and wondering how such a product could have been released without more testing.
The model I received was the i7-10750H 10th Gen, 16GB DDR4 RAM, 1TB SSD, Nvidia GTX 1650 It with 4GB GDDR6, Window 10 Plowright off the bat, I loved this came with Windows 10 Pro. As a work computer, there are some settings I cant change unless I am on the pro version of windows, so the average user might not benefit from that, but I very much appreciated it. This is a creators edition laptop, so it suits most of my needs as an instructional designer, especially with the fact that some editing software is included as a trial. Pros:- the screen is amazing and responsive- will easily run games like Final Fantasy XIV (benchmark was 12,000 on HIGH)- palm rest feels amazing and allows for pretty responsive typing- included in the box is a mini hub, which has an HDMI and USB-A port- turns on and is ready to go when the laptop is opened- i7 10th generation and the graphics card make this future-proof for the next 2-3 years Cons:- 1tb SSD is overkill and drives up the cost of the computer (save money and get half that size)- the track pad is so uncomfortable to use- took 3 days of updating to have the computer up and functioning - some applications (like Chrome) have some issues still and crash- the battery life on max battery saver, doing internet browsing, lasts about 4 hours on a full charge- charging is done by a 130-Watt Type-C 3-Prong AC Adapter - a regular USB-C cable will not charge this- ONLY HAS USB-C ports - to really get the most out of this computer, invest in a thunderbolt 3-USB-C docking station (the downside is a good one will run $150 or more)Overall, the cons outweighed the pros for me on the XPS, which is why I gave it 4 stars. While impressive as a creators edition computer, beyond that, it doesnt feel like a 5 star computer, especially with the track pad and the necessity of needing a docking station.***When considering a computer and the price, I always look at the price and then how many years I can expect to get out of it and then use that as a guide to see if the computer is worth it to purchase for that price per year. The 2020 Dell XPS 15 should be a reliable machine with components that wont age out technologically for 3 years or so. Considering that and the retail price of the model, I dont think this is worth $700 a year if it even lasts 3 years for my job as an instructional designer.  ***
This is one sleek Dell laptop that is easy to carry around. It is small and compact, but my favorite feature is the screen quality.  As a photographer, it is very important for me to make sure the images on screen are uniform and not distorted. The screen is better than regular High Def, as it is anti-reflective 1920 x 1200 with no distortion in luminosity from any angle due to the Corning Gorilla Glass 6, that is designed to allow touch screen. The processor is top notch and booting time is very fast, and the SSD hard drive also helps. Although the laptop has USB-C connections at the right and left side, there is a USB-C to regular USB connector that is included separately. I was pleased that setup took just a few minutes and I was ready to go. Dell really did an outstanding job with this one - I wish my Dell work computer would be half as this one.
The Dell model that I received was the DELL XPS 13 9300 with the Intel i7-1065G7 processor running a clock speed of 1.30 GHZ. The installed RAM was 32 GB and the ran the Windows 10 64-bit operating system. It was a thin ultra-light weight unit that weighed only 2.8 lbs. And The machine also had a 1920 x 1080-pixel screen with 10 touch support points. The had a 1.8 T SSD for storage. The unboxing of the machine is straight forward no unnecessary extra packaging, and I pulled it out I was wowed right away. It is probably one best looking Ultrabook I had seen. Crafted with polished aluminum and black carbon fiber palm rest. The heavy-duty hinge which can be opened with one hand! I charged the unit via the USB-C port. There are two one on each side for which well thought of. The included power adaptor had a connector with a LED light that informs the user that it is charging the notebook. There is also a microphone jack and micro SD card reader. All pretty typical of machines this size. I initially hunted for the power button which is not marked. I was informed that it serves as a fingerprint reader too for folks that need that added security but have not tried it out, but I think it will make it even better. The keyboard is superlative and well thought and the keys were very responsive with adequate spacing. The LED back lighting was a handy feature specially when u work in a darkened surrounding. The track pad was responsive, and navigating was breeze. The screen was an absolute delight. Dell has implemented a 16 x10 aspect ratio in the small body with a bevel less screen. The webcam is right on the top and very functional. Colors are very impressive for a screen of this size. The brightness of the screen adjusts with the ambient light which was a welcome feature. The screen becomes really bright and when I was using it on my balcony in the sunlight there were no issues with visibility unit I received was devoid of any bloatware and it loaded up surprisingly fast for a windows machine. I installed a version of MS Office 365 and went through the apps on it. There was no lag in loading heaps, and all ran fast. Surfing the net using Chrome or Edge was fast and web pages loaded quickly. The battery life was really a pleasant surprise. I played some movies via Netflix and the battery lasted over 10 hours. For an ultra-book this size I thought it was good. Overall, the XPS 13 in my configuration was really a great experience very comparable to the MA though I have not compared the two yet. For someone looking for ultra-light weight windows notebook with great screen, great battery life and very responsive to common programs the DELL XPS 13 is one great machine. Only reason to give it 4 stars instead of 5 is the lack of ports - there are only USB C ports on the device so you have to use a dongle, but they supply one (and this is no different than Apple MacBook).
TL;DR?-- great as a standalone laptop-- adding a mouse or external displays -- be prepared to spend (even more) money--------------------------------------------------I have to admit that Im already used to this laptop since it is very similar (but nicer) than our standard-issue laptop from my employer.  So, keyboard layout etc. feels comfortable. The screen is terrific -- this is the first touchscreen I have had and not sure how much I will use it because a) Im accustomed to trackpads and b) Im OCD about fingerprints on my screen and this has a glossy layer that would become a fingerprint magnet. This isnt the lightest weight laptop you will find -- but it also seems more solidly built than most.  No flex in the keyboard etc. so appreciate the solid and substantial feel. The bezel is EXTREMELY narrow -- if you are used to covering up your webcam, you will be hard-pressed to find a cover that wont encroach on the screen. With the specs, this is about as fast as you would expect it to be.  Im not a gamer but cant abide spiny circles as I am working the Puckout of the box, this does feel quite warm -- I can feel the heat through the keyboard as I am typing this.  I hope this doesnt mean that this will develop heat or thermal issues.  That said, the bottom seems to be not as warm as the top of the keyboard. One thing Im not wild about is that it does not have a built-in USB port.  Instead there is an adapter that you can plug into a USB-C port -- but Im quite sure that will quickly get lost... The reason this is an issue is if you have a trackball or other peripheral that still uses a standard USB-A dongle, well, you will have something sticking out a couple of inches. In terms of being able to hook up to external displays -- once again, I am not seeing any display ports -- so if you are going to need some sort of docking station and those can cost a couple of hundred bucks -- on top of a laptop that you are already spending over 2K on it. So as a standalone machine -- this great.  However, to use this in desktop mode you will have to spend more money and lose some of the slim cool form factor that Dell has tried so hard to maintain.

First thing that I thought about when I got this, was how durable it would be. Often with thickness comes strength, and thin equates to weaker. That would have been the case if they used traditional materials for this, instead, it is made from aluminum, well the bottom. They were able to get this unit as thin as they did use lots of aluminum and the glass for the screen. When closed, there is almost no flex, you really must apply pressure to get some flex in it. The screen alone has some flex, this is fin but it is still more sturdy than most laptops I have laid my hands on, and as a tech who repaired them and worked with many different brands, I can say most are super flimsy. In this case, it is not flimsy at all, and it is true that most computers I worked on were cheap, but not all. Overall, they were able to get it this thin because of a good engineering. If I had to say there was any downfalls of this unit, it would have to be that it only has two USB -C / Thunderbolt 3 ports. It also has ads card reader, but so does the station I have to make up for this lack of ports. Realistically, this downfall of only two ports is defeated when you use a docking station. I can add 8 sub ports using the station as well as ethernet, a HDMI to monitor, as well as audio in/out. The other issue is that, with testing, the USB C / Thunderbolt charger isnt able to fuel this computer to its fullest, its only  a few watt drop, but while on the dock station, I get a full 45 watts to the computer, and I see improvements in the processor boost speeds as a result. While the Dell unit is rated for 45 watts, and it should be able to do more, I am not sure why, but the computer only asks for around 40 on that unit. That 5-watt difference was the difference between seeing 2.43ghz to seeing boost speeds up to 3.4ghz. When it came down to actual performance I felt though, I didnt notice any difference. Good news though, you can charge this unit from either side and this is extremely convenient. When using a dock station like mine, you can charge and use that sub port for more. Performance wise, this Dell XPS is pretty good. It uses a Knoxian SSD for the 2TB that see seq speeds of 3094MB/s read and 2826MB/s write. Random speeds still fare well here, with 2041MB/s and 1724MB/s which is more indicative to what you would see in real life application. Other versions of this laptop that I saw reviewed had Intel based SSDs that did not perform as well, but still very good. Knoxian makes their own nan chips as well, formerly being called Toshiba. The ram that is permanently installed to the motherboard on this, is 32GB at 3733MHz. This is good when paired with the processor on board. The Intel Iris graphics unit is a huge leap for them, though probably nothing like the upcoming graphics options, but it substantially improves the performance of graphics verse previous generations, with 64 compute units verse the 48 of the last gen. You can play games on this laptop, but it is really not the best thing as many of the games will still need to be scaled back in the resolution and graphics settings likely have to be put on low, but it does open up other options. Either way, interacting with the unit is a very fast experience when it comes to using applications or web browsing. I have taken up doing CAD and some of the scripting for games my son is making. I am personally learning alongside him to make games. The display on this Dell XPS is amazing. Color accuracy is great, and colors are properly saturated, maybe a bit blooming though which offers some wow factors when watching shows. This is likely due to the HDR that this is compatible with. With a screen that has 500 nits brightness and a 10bit display, I think this is qualified as an HDR 500 from the Visa certification for HDR. It seems to have some form of Adaptive Contrast enabled, which I am not sure how to disable. Based on the content you are looking at; the screen will look darker or lighter. The change is sudden but not immediate to what you are viewing.  It also seems that the monitors brightness will adjust to the light levels of a room, this is only made apparent based on when I used it before using it again. When I would use it in the middle of the day, it would be brighter. I would stop, and turn it on later in the evening when it was dark, and the light would darken, but with a delay that would alert me to what it was before suddenly changing to the darker mode. The screen is one amazing display though and the HDR experience with this monitor has been great so far. One of the best, outside of the screen, performance, as well as sturdy case, would be keyboard feel. The keyboard on this is no mechanical keyboard, and I honestly wouldnt be able to type as well on it compared to my aqua switches, but it feels better giving me clear indication when a button is pressed, offering a firm resistance that doesnt tire my fingers out on prolonged runs. All the keys are stable, with no wobble to them and offer an amazingly well spaced layout that takes the entire width of the base, with maybe 1/4 an inch boarder on the outsides. The mouse on this works well, with clear clicks and smooth operation due to the amazing texture and material they used for the surface. There is some discoloration when used though on that touch pad, but it is minor and normal for smooth surfaces verse the oil that keeps our skin healthy. I am sure that the white version of this wouldnt show as this is more of a black plastic problem, but the black plastic looks so good with the carbon fiber design making it hard to pass it up. Just as a notification, as I was hoping it was one, this is not an active touch screen, but instead capacitive. Works great with your fingers, but not with stylus pens or active ones. I could use the back on one of my capacitive pens meant for tablets though. So, this screen will not be good for drawing on, this means I must do my cad as a hybrid option between a drawing tablet and touch interface. I investigated it and found that the Dell XPS 13 2in1 does have an active touch option that works with the type of pen I brought up though. This was a bit of a letdown that could have been made better by investigation the type of touch screen it was before I got the active pen. To summarize, this is one amazing laptop, Dell really did a lot of engineering on this one and it shows. It is amazingly sturdy, the display is gorgeous, the performance is above my needs, and it has been a pleasure to use for me. There have been zero software issues, no driver problems, and outside of the PSU not providing as much power as my down, it has been great. That Dell PSU is great though, really compact, and designed to be wrapped up unlike many others I have seen. It does a great job and I wouldnt have noticed much if it werent for a USB wattage meter that I plugged in. I would have been scratching my head trying to figure out why I saw higher boost clocks for the cup on the station verse when on the normal charger. Boost clocks are not sustainable and not something that I saw any benefit for in the long-term stress test as both showed the same draw and speed when stressed out. The boost does help with small programs loading a bit quicker, and I couldnt tell you the difference in time as they didnt seem to be much different from my perspective. With that rant out of the way, this Dell XPS 9300 has been a joy to work with. Great job Dell. Seriously, I was trying to find faults, and I was left defeated here.
good laptop when it comes to specs, design, and software. Problem is that the fans run all the time and there are no controls to prevent this. Dell has removed the windows power plan control settings that influence CPU load and fan control in their own app, which can be configured to quite mode, but fans are still running all the time.
Dell XPS 15 9500 15.6-inch UHD Touchscreen Laptop (Silver) Intel Core i7-10750H 10th Gen, 16GB DDR4 RAM, 1TB SSD, Nvidia GTX 1650 It with 4GB GDDR6, Window 10 Pro (XPS9500-7845SLV-PUS) is a gorgeous laptop. Summary What I liked:- Gorgeous display- Highly configurable BIOS- Sturdy aluminum body- Included mini USB-C hub- Windows 10 Pro, not Home What can be improved:- Average-quality keyboard- Average-quality speakers Display - size and aspect ratio Display is the best part of this laptop. Its UHD and has 3840x2400 pixels. A normal UHD (4K) display has 3840x2160 pixels, so this display has 240 more pixels vertically, hence UHD.  As a result, the aspect ratio is 16:10 instead of normal UHD displays 16:9. I really like the extra vertical space, because it helps viewing long web pages and reading long emails. It is especially helpful for a small display like this 15.6-inch display. I also like the fast that this display is edge-to-edge. It looks so modern and sleek. Display - colors This display has excellent color gamut of 100% Adobe RGB and 94% DCI-P3 This is much, much, wider than normal laptop displays color gamut which barely covers sRGB which is only 70% of Adobe RGB. The wider gamut means richer and deeper colors. Its also worth mentioning that this laptops display was calibrated very well out of box. For other two laptops I bought this year, I had to use calibrator to create a custom ICC profile for them to get correct colors. I did that too with this laptop, but it didnt make any noticeable difference. Display - contrast ratio and brightness This displays contrast ratio is 1650:1 which is not as high as high-end external monitors but still decent for a laptop. Higher contrast ratio results in darker, richer black. The maximum brightness of this display 500 nits, which is very, very bright. It almost hurt my eyes at the brightest setting. Bright display really helps when you are working outside. BIOS You can use the standard pressing F2 key during boot up method to enter the BIOS. This is one of the most advanced PC BIOS I have ever seen. Its so highly configurable (see photos). You can use a mouse for navigation, too. If you are like me and keep this laptop on the AC adapter regularly, go to Power settings and choose Primarily AC Use or Custom (see photo). This prevents the battery to be fully charged when on AC adapter, as keeping a lithium battery at 100% State of Charge for a long period of time is bad for its longevity. I personally use Custom setting with start charging at 50% and stop charging at 60%. Keyboard is the least exciting part of this laptop to me. Its not bad but compared to other high-end laptop keyboards like ThinkPad and MacBook Pros, it feels average. You can tell the difference when you press hard on keys in the middle, like G and H. The keyboard caves in a bit. This makes a huge difference when you type for hours. Its sad that manufactures tend to pay little attention to keyboards, because they dont have marketing appeals like number of pixels or CPU speed. Key touch is on the soft side. Speaker Speakers of this laptop is also average. Its loud, but the sound (especially the bass) becomes less and less clear as you turn up the volume. I feel vibration on the keyboard, track pad, and palm rests, too. Its perfectly fine for zoom meeting or watching non music YouTube videos, though. Webcam and fingerprint conodont expect too much from the webcam of this laptop. Its only HD (1280x720 pixels) resolution and takes videos at 30 fps. The lens is smaller than a grain of rice thanks to edge-to-edge display. Fingerprint sensor works very fast and reliably. This webcam supports Windows Hello login, so you can configure it to do face recognition login instead of fingerprint login. Fan noise This is a high-power i7 laptop, so it makes a fair amount of noise when CPU is running at its full speed. Probably, you dont want to use this laptop as a desktop replacement in a quiet home or office. Software This laptop comes with Windows 10 Pro, as opposed to Home, so you can join a corporate Active Directory domain, use bit locker to secure storage, create and run Hyper-V virtual machines, and become a Remote Desktop server. I like that this laptop doesnt come with much bloatware, except for McAfee anti-virus software. It sends out tons of desktop notifications, so I usually uninstall it right away. Even uninstalling it wasnt straightforward, because it was divided into several applications, and some of them had to be uninstalled first before uninstalling others. Accessories This laptop comes with a mini USB-C hub that features a standard-size HDMI port and a USB-A port (see photos). This laptop doesnt have any USB-A port, so this is a nice bonus. It also comes with a 130 W USB-C AC adapter. Its smaller than a bank note and light weight (see photo).
This is not a portable machine. I would categorize it as a movable workstation. It is heavy and thick. The pictures do not represent how thick this machine is because it is a wedge. For the aesthetics of a wedge they removed a lot of space for a battery and stuff. Also, the wedge has a lot of sharp edges around. If you plan to carry it around, invest into shoes with steel plate protection for toes. It may be handy in fighting off any competition at the office, as I suppose this feature was designed for instant decapitation. For the thickness, they could have put 20 USB Type-A ports all around this laptop in 2 layers. But there is none. Turns out, the whole world still needs Type-A. The point of USB-C was to make the machines thin, so what gives? There is an intake at the bottom, which requires a straight, hard surface to drop this chunk onto. No hugging it in bed or on the beach. It is to uncomfortable anyway. The touchpad feels like cheap crap. Clicks randomly, wobbles, does not respond, comes in touch with everything due to its size, etc... worst experience ever. There is a big gap between it and the housing, which makes you wonders what will jump out of it. The power brick is relatively small but has a thick and cumbersome AC cable. Also, the cable requires a ground support, which is ridiculous as USB-C power adapters made to specs do not require grounding. Something odd here. As for the software.... its Windows 10 Spy-Bloatware. No need to comment that. [Setup takes hours and you need to plug a cord into your brain and upload your consciousness to the mothership.]
I thought I was getting a laptop cube, turns out it was not as futuristic.
So, I got this laptop for both me and my son. My son knows all the ins and outs of laptops and all the computer lingo. Me? Not so much. I know enough to use it for watching movies, email, the occasional writing I do, and web surfing. So basically, I use it for basic tasks so that is what Im going to base my review around. This laptop is almost 5 pounds, but it feels solid. The keyboard is a little more click than my old Mac laptop, but I dont mind it. I was excited about it being touch screen as Im not a huge fan of touch pads, mostly because I grew up using a mouse so thats what Im used to. While I really love the option of touchscreen and use it a decent amount, the fingerprints on the screen are terrible looking on this.  The touchscreen needs a screen protector thats anti fingerprint and anti-glare. However, Im having a really hard time finding any kind of accessories for this as its so new. Which I knew would be a problem for a month or so when I got it. Everything is very easy to find and do on here. Even for someone who has had a MacBook for years its self-explanatory. And anything I cant figure out I use tube to find. Hamate only issue I have had that my son pointed out theres a known issue with the touchpad and ours has it as you can see in the video. What is troubling about this is that the box that it came in had multiple shipping labels and it looks like this was shipped to amazon, shipped back to dell, presumably to fix this issue, then sent back to amazon then to me. And its still bad. I personally dont use the touchpad enough to bother getting it fixed and my son said he isnt that worried about it. But I know I would be very annoyed if I paid over $2,000 for a laptop and it still has this issue even after getting sent back to be fixed.
This laptop has the latest Intel CPU, plenty of memory, lots of super-fast storage, and even the Pro edition of Widows 10 (which rarely comes with a new PC).  The only thing missing is a dedicated graphics system needed for serious gaming and heavy graphics work.  However, most who used a PC for games or heavy graphics usually opt for a desktop or a flaming laptop with a bigger and more expensive screen with fast refresh rates.  I see this PC as a good option for those who like the portability of a tablet but also want the power of a laptop.  I also own several tablets and a Surface laptop which is very similar to this PC.  So far, I have found this laptop to be better of the two.  The power of the 10th generation i7 processor is very evident and it boots up super-fast as soon as you raise the screen.  The keyboard is nice with responsive keys and touchpad.  It does get warm after prolonged use but never really very hot like my Surface does.  The battery life appears to be very good so far and is better than any of my other dozen or so laptops.  It is thin but it is heavier than I expected.  I do recommend this little powerhouse if you are not intending to use it for heavy gaming or graphics.  It is good enough however for Adobe CS.  I would also recommend a good case to protect it from damage.
This is surprisingly thin. I mean, really, thin. You could tuck this in your messenger bag and still have room for textbooks, notebooks, etc. It is a true space-saver. The convertible option is amazing. When Im done grading papers, I can fold this in the opposite direction, prop it on my desk (or bed) and watch Netflix.  Likewise, I have used this same configuration while cooking. It made it much easier to follow tutorials. Love it! You can also convert it into a tablet configuration. The color is rich, the sound is big and full, and the brightness is impressive. The keys are backlit but sleep after a period of disuse (you can also dim them as well as entirely turn them off). They are shallow but have a clear actuation point. Likewise, the touchpad is sensitive, but not too sensitive. This is perfect for regular use (work, watching videos, shopping, etc.) and for very light gaming. I really love the portability and versatility of this laptop! Phenomenal for students, teachers, and anyone just seeking a laptop for everyday use. Highly recommended!
Best laptop Ive used in the last few years. I want to preface by saying Im a Mac fan, I purchased my first MacBook Air in 2013 and never had any reason to return to a Windows device (the Dell XPS was for my husband originally but I absolutely loved it so its now my main device). The form factor is so slim, its lightweight and ultra-portable with a great battery life. The screen is beautiful with thin bezels and the option to use as a tablet too. It you just need something for school/streaming or something with more power for video/photo editing the specs on this device are powerful enough for most tasks. A Few Negatives -The fingerprint sensor isnt great, if often fails and Im required to enter my punim really missing USB ports and having to carry a dongle around just in case I need it is a little annoying.
We love this little laptop.  Stuff to know (from our observations so far): -This is a thin (thick at its thickest) beautiful little machine. -Theres a Micro SD card slot, which is great!  Its a spring-assisted mechanism used to remove the card.  It sits really flush otherwise.  Id rather it goes into the machine more, just to keep it from ejecting when carrying around.  It doesnt just fall out.  Im in IT, so Im on the go in the field.  I want to make sure my stuff is secure. -The carbon fiber interior is SEXY.  Its smooth and tactile.  You WANT to have your hands on it. -You only get 2 USB-C ports.  The mercy there is that they are both Thunderbolt 3 (verified using a Thunderbolt 3 drive with it).  This means its stupid fast.  Its just a higher class of port. -There is a phenomenon concerning disappearing ports on laptops.  I miss copious amounts of jacks.  This comes with a USB-C to USB-A adapter, which is nice to have.  You will need it. -The bezel is slight, as well as the camera.  Its but a wee dot. You wont be able to use the standard camera covers on this.  Paranoid people beware. -I like chunky keys on my keyboard, and these are more Chiclet-y.  Thats a personal preference thing.  I know you can turn this thing into a tablet, so that was likely a design factor.  But all, I would be SO uncomfortable sitting this thing on the keys.  To me, thats sacrilege. Id have to use the old tent formation to go with the tablet look.  When you do bend the hinges, it asks you if you want to convert to tablet mode. -The screen feels good.  Its BRIGHT and very responsive.  The speakers are impressive for their size.  Its loud but lacks the more bass notes if youre doing music. But nature documentaries?  The colors and sounds are perfect. -This is expensive, but Ive always understood that this is basically the best 13 2 in 1 laptop.  If you want that kind of performance (and youre NOT a gamer), this is a thing of beauty. Since the COVID, laptops are rather hard to come by.  My mom needs something to do some work on, so shes going to be using it at least for a little while.  I think the versatility of the design will be perfect for her.  Then, it comes back to us where it belongs
EDIT: This laptop is so prone to overheating that it must be shut off at night. Otherwise the fan kicks in so loudly that it wakes my daughter up! I got this laptop for my daughter, who was long overdue for a new one. She primarily uses a computer to watch Netflix, make YouTube videos, and do the usual things like Facebook and email. Her previous laptop was a monstrously huge laptop that was designed to sit on a desk, so her first observation was that the screen is smaller. But of course, her new laptop is superior in nearly every other way. Here are her observations some of which were in response to my pointed questions based on other reviewers experiences: I do not like the track pad. Its annoying, and it doesnt always work right. Its too big. It does not have a wobble, but theres no way to right click. Maybe thats not going to be a problem once I get used to it; maybe its just the way of the world now. The video editing software works. Its good for being on a laptop. The video editing software came pre-installed. And its not the crappy one that no likes. Its the one Im used to. I can tell that the graphics are excellent. The sound quality is excellent. The box was not banged up. The laptop was not banged up. The box was sturdy. The laptop appears to be brand new. Came with free virus protection. No disk drive, but those are a thing of the past, anyway. No USB drive, but theres an adaptor with it. * * *I saw my daughters face the moment she figured out; this is a touchscreen She was so excited. It is also worth noting that she set this laptop up by herself straight out of the box. When we chatted using the Dells webcam to test it, the colors and lighting seemed to be off to me. Everything looked a bit pale compared to FaceTime. Perhaps she just needs to fiddle with the settings.
I did not expect this laptop to be so slick looking.  It really gives the MacBook Air a run for its money.  And it brings the power with the i7.  Im not 100% sure if an i5 wouldnt have been enough in here: I dont think Im about to use this for gaming (which cares more about GPU than CPU anyway), but my wife wants to try photoshop on it to see if the touchscreen makes photo editing any different.  The screen is small, but because its borderless, its not that much smaller than my 15-inch laptops screen.  The keyboard is a bit cramped, and theres no way I would be able to type as quickly.  At home, a dock and an external mechanical keyboard would be a must. If I ever go back to making sales calls at customers offices, this will make a very nice impression.  The only downside is that it is so small and thin that I am absolutely TERRIFIED of breaking it. Also, while Dell *used* to include a lot of bloatware, this appears to be stock win10 and performs exactly as you would hope. That said the one thing that blew me away is the sound.  Using this for a zoom call or watching a movie is amazing, and a feature that I really really really didnt expect.  The speakers are on the bottom of the laptop, and it uses this to create what is basically crystal-clear surround sound.  Im so blown away by it that theres no question this gets five stars.
I got 32Gb version of this machine as a gift. Since the day it arrived, I am facing connectivity issues with the external Logitech keyboard and Evicting mouse where both devices have terrible lag. Both accessories work perfectly even with a 350 dollars laptop. I have upgraded to the latest BIOS version 1.6.2 but issue is still there. Once on restart the BIOS gave a message that the hard drive is not found, I felt like dead as a hard drive on this machine is onboard and in case anything goes wrong with your laptop your data is gone and you have to pay thousands to recover it. Thankfully on manual restart the hard drive was found. Dell community forum and their support has not been useful as they advise you all the basic procedures to fix it which even anyone with little PC knowledge can do. I am also having trouble using it with brand new BenQ monitor with two HDMI inputs. Whenever I turn off monitor the laptop starts producing sounds as if you are plugging or unplugging a device. Some people are also reporting Wi-Fi___33 issues.
Im very pleased with this Dell New XPS 13 9300 13.4-inch UHD Infinity Edge Touchscreen Laptop (Silver). I like that I can use all day and it still has enough charge to let me work some more in the morning-when I say work I mean I have a lot of emails and even some links on them, I do shopping anymore. I make sure I keep it on just the desk or table when not using-I have felt the bottom and it is very warm so I have a little table by my chair I use in the TV room. Im not comfortable trying to type with it in my lap. I know how fast I am getting online but I dont use many of the features. Its a very nice screen size but not overwhelming-shows lots of details-I buy fabric online a lot.  I was surprised at the price, but it seems everything is a little higher price in this pandemic.
This Dell XPS 15 9500 laptop is a solid computer for both work and play, but a few things keep it from being a 5-star computer for me for the price. The specs are powerful for sure:  Intel i7 processor, 16 GB RAM, 1 TB SSD drive, and I think it carry me through the 3 to 5 years minimum that I expect from a laptop these days. Battery power is just okay.  I found that with regular office work use starting with a full charge, I needed to recharge it midday.  I havent had issues with loud fans, but it also does run hot after a couple hours of use, but so far that hasnt caused it to shut down without warning from overheating. The total weight is somewhat heavy for my taste, but it also feels tank-like and durable. The screen is gorgeous, and its easily my favorite part of the laptop, and the touchscreen is accurate and responsive. The touchpad is probably my least favorite part of the laptop.  Its functional and I dont think its defective like some other reviewers have reported for theirs, but its not the most comfortable to use. Luckily, I usually lean harder on my favorite mouse or the touchscreen, so I just avoid using it. Im also not into Dells keyboards.  The buttons arent squishy but theyre a little hard.  More irritating is how this keyboard doesnt have dedicated Pagan or Pug keys and you must use Function the Up or Down arrows.  Ive made myself adapt to the loss, but normal Pug and Pagan keys are available on laptops with smaller screens/dimensions, so this is not my preference havent any trouble with the speakers so far. The headphone jack is a little rigid you do need to make sure the cord end snaps into place.  Same with the webcam; it didnt wow me, but it was fine.  But if a cutting-edge webcam is important to you, this probably isnt it.  Note that the bezel is super narrow so if you need to cover the lens for security reasons, youre going to need a teeny tiny sticker to cover it without obscuring part of the top of the screen. It has no old-style USB Type-A ports on the body of the laptop, just the three USB-C ports, but thats becoming more and more par for the course with newer laptops and Chromebooks.  And it comes with a free mini hub, which has an HDMI and USB-A port if you need those. It comes with an average amount of bloatware, and even though I got this computer right around the release date, you will likely need to deal with the simple yet tedious process of installing Dell firmware updates and Windows security updates before the computer is completely ready to use.  It comes with Windows 10 and there are preinstalled Start Menu links to try Office 365 for a few days but of course it needs to be purchased separately.
This is a glorious laptop. The downfall is that it comes at the cost of a lot of weight. This thing is heavy. Exceptionally heavy for a laptop. Even the thick laptops from decades ago were not this heavy. You can use this thing to tone your biceps. Not something lightweight and portable for travel. Keep that in mind if you want something lightweight. If the weight isnt an issue, it is a superb laptop. Specs speak for themselves. This can handle anything you want or need to do, all at once, too. Build quality is impeccable. Screen is the best Ive seen. Stunning, especially for a laptop. Crystal clear and gorgeous. Glare isnt as bad as I expected with the type of screen, but there is glare. Not as bad as some other glossy screens that I have had over the years though. Touchscreen is immediately responsive and was perfectly calibrated. Trackpad is probably the best I have ever experienced, and I have/have had so many laptops over the years. I love the large area and how smooth it feels. It is very accurate and responsive. No wobbling. Soft click. Keyboard is nice to type on fluidly. Very quiet. Keys are low - they do not protrude much. You dont experience skipping keys or anything like that. Nice rubberized matte finish on the trim surrounding keyboard and trackpad. Very smooth, but not slippery soft feel. You can plug the charger in on either side to charge the laptop, which is a nice convenience. It is one heck of a machine and very nice to use. Everything about it just feels good regarding typing, using trackpad, etc. No complaints with actual use of it at all. It is super-fast, efficient, and a solid workhorse, as well as great for entertainment purposes like watching movies or videos or certain gaming. It feels durable and sturdy with the aluminum build. Screen doesnt feel too thin or fragile. Aside from the weight, the only thing I can find to gripe about is the heat. The bottom gets hot almost immediately. I am not sure if that is typical due to the specs and it should expect, or if it is something I should worry about. The little raised areas on the bottom to allow the heat to escape when resting on a flat surface are not enough. Needs to be up on a riser or stand to allow more air flow. Other than that, it is a glorious beast.
The XPS 15 models have been the top of the line for Dell for a few years. This year seems like no exception and Dell has gone one step further with the amazing high-resolution screen (higher than 4k!?) and the great build quality that is s step up from previous years. I was happy to see that they went away from OLED screens even though I really like them overall, they really dont work that well for lighter gaming or for color accurate work. They can be very good, so dont get me wrong here, I love OLEDs, I just think they have more tradeoffs than you want for a laptop / work machine. This machine and its high specs are nearly perfect. I did upgrade to 32gb of ram and my understanding is that it can take up to 64 gab. (maybe 128?) The bottom panel is a little harder to remove than previous years, but not hard. Look for some dell-based videos or a YouTube video showing you how before you jump in. I was also very pleased to see a second NVME slot, but disappointed that it didnt come with the heatsink that the stock drive comes with. I guess you will either need to apply your own heatsink material or order another one from Dell. At this price point, those details should be included (IMHO). The machine has all the needed accessories including a full-sized SD Card slot. All in all, the fit and finish on the new 15-inch Dell XPS is amazing and the updated / refreshed look is all positive while maintaining a winning form factor / build quality / design of the previous versions. If you are in the market for the best PC / Laptop you can buy, this is one for your comparison list.
I havent been a fan of Dell computers in the past.  In my experience they come bloated with extra software that cant be removed and are almost impossible to work on.  This is the first one that I have owned in a long time and I was pleasantly surprised.  The only bloatware that comes on it is Dells phone app that is a replica of the one built into the OS and their support app.  Both can be removed if you choose.  Normally I would do a clean Windows install to get rid of all the crap, but I didnt have to this time. I read a lot of reviews that the touchscreen wasnt responsive, but I havent experienced any problems with it.  I think that might have been fixed in a software update.  The combination of Intel 10th gen I-7 processor, 16gb of DD4 ram and M.2 NVME SSD makes this laptop blazing fast.  The ram can be upgraded to 32gb and it has two free M.2 slots available.  It comes with a 1tb M.2 PCI-E SSD and the other two free slots are easily accessed to be able to add more.  Most laptops these days come with integrated graphics cards but this one has a dedicated Nvidia GTX 1650 TI.  Im not a heavy gamer so Im not sure how it would perform with graphics intensive games, but I think would hold its own.  Ive thrown multitasking with several excel sheets on different monitors and some light gaming on it and havent had any lag at all. I would rate the battery life as average.  Depending on how I use it and the screen brightness I can get about 6-8 hours on a charge.  The good thing is that it doesnt take long at all to charge back up.  30 minutes of charging will net you another 3-4 hours. My only gripe about this laptop is the fingerprint sensor.  It is built in with the power button and I often must try multiple times to get it to read or end up putting my pin in.  I would have like it better if they would have had a separate for the sensor.  With that said though I absolutely love it.  It is leaps and bounds above the Gen 2 Surface pro laptop that I was using.
This is a beautiful laptop! inside & out.... Dell has really made a fantastic blend of form & function with this XPS 9300 touchscreen UHD 13.4 in. Laptop.... it truly shines. Set up is a 10-minute breeze.... less if you like to run in stealth mode without all the bells n whistles. Stability is a wonderful thing, and this laptop could not trip over itself if you tied its Ram to its Rom while running backwards.?  makes no sense but you get the picture, this laptop is a smooth-running glitch free machine. And it is a cool running machine, well ventilated with 2 fans, & the all-aluminum case helps a bit as well... it always feels cool to the touch. Build Quality - nothing less than awesome, the engineering that went this is amazing.... you can really feel the quality when you touch this laptop.... it makes you think, Wow! this is nice :)Sound - is about the best I have heard in a laptop.... loud enough to hear clearly even with a fan on high nearby...Speaking of sound when I the last time you heard this? Dude... I got a Dell!  sorry, always wanted to say that :) remember the Dell commercial guy? Any who -As many have pointed out... this is not a laptop designed to game with, it is a work/business machine... that IS good for some entertainment via streaming movies, YouTube edutainment act. as the video quality is excellent. I love the touchscreen feature; it just comes in handy sometimes .... and Dells touchscreen functions flawlessly. And going from a closed/cold start to open/up n running is faster than ever with the one touch power/start button. So thin.... will fit easily into laptop carry bags n backpacks. MO this is THE Best Laptop in the lightweight/business class category.... it just has it all & then some...Dell scores a big win win with this one....5 Stars Quality Product Recommendation Dude - you need to get a Dell :)

If you are in the market for a new 2 in 1 laptop, I would highly recommend this one.
This DELL features 16 gigs of ram and a 512 gig of SSD.  Like the new Macs it doesnt have ports that can be used without an adapter.  Personally, Im annoyed by that, but its the industry standard. The XPS 13 would be a good work computer.  It comes with Windows Pro which is a definite upgrade to what you get with most PCs.  The screen is nice with very little border.  That said, its doesnt compare to the clarity of Apple laptops.  By which I mean the pixel density is not the same.  But certainly, good for work-from-home. The XPS 13 is also not a gamer computer.  The graphics are good enough for most purposes but not intense gaming requirements.  I streamed videos and movies and it performs. ODDLY enough I found the laptop a little difficult to open because there is no pocket to slip your finger into.  Also, I should tell you that the speakers are set up for streaming/Bluetooth to other devices.  Which is to say that the in-house speakers are initially disabled and looking for external output. The most serious problem I ran across was overheating.  This slim and stylish laptop is not one you can use on your lap and I highly recommend that you get a cooling unit for it.  Mine overheated on a shelf and we had an H of a time getting it to turn off so it could cool down.  Lesson learned. Overall a very good unit for work-at-home.  Set up was even easier than our last Dell.
I waffled between giving this a 4 star or 5-star review. In the end, its in between but since there isnt an option for a 4.5 star, I rounded up to be fair. Im not a huge tech person but I have used several computers over the years and know what I like and this laptop is a solid computer with a touchscreen option that makes it more desirable for me to travel with than a tablet. PROS: --Beautiful design and color: The Platinum silver looks sleek. --Lightweight: The size and weight make this ultraportable. Its a tad bigger than a tablet--Full keyboard for easy typing--The 16:10 display is awesome--Great webcam--Able to set up for facial recognition, fingerprint, or password--Good amount of storage--Decent battery power--Great screen touchpad - I love having this option. Its like having a tablet but with the functionality of a laptop--Easy set up Cons:--Price - Buyers pay a premium for the added features--Limited Ports - I cant plug my flash drives into this and have to buy a separate USB-C port to flash drive or buy the special flash drive--Gets hot after several hours on lap Overall, Im excited about the portability of this laptop and it will replace what I have as my go to laptop for travel. Plus, I love having the touch screen which makes a lot of things faster for me than using a mouse.
Let me start by saying that Im travelling right now. With me, I have this laptop, along with my work laptop, a 2020 16 MacBook Pro, and an iPad Pro with Magic Keyboard. Not once I have reached for the MacBook. I absolutely love the form factor of this 13 Dell. Its tiny, but the screen and keyboard are magnificent! The screen has rich, gorgeous colors that radiate across a near-bezel-free presentation. The Gorilla Glass touch screen is incredibly useful when consuming content, like the newspaper. In addition, the keyboard is comfortable and full-sized, despite this laptop tight little package. In addition to the form factor, the laptop is speedy and comes with loads of storage and RAM. I regularly edit photos is Lightroom and its working perfectly. I often have dozen windows open, including Lightroom, a Figma design document (Im a UX designer) with heavy graphical elements, and Pandora or YouTube TV running in the background. This little laptop supports it all. In fact, its hard to find ANYTHING bad to say about it. But Ill stretch a bit and say that it can get a little hot. That said, even at its hottest, its still quiet. If youre looking for a great laptop that incredibly portable and lightweight, look no further. Im truly in love with this gem
This is one heck of a computer in a little package! Its snappy, very fast on and offline. Im a content creator, so I spend hours in word, PowerPoint, publisher, etc. Through it all, this laptop has been a dream. I love the USBC/thunderbolt ports, its very modern. If you do still use standard USB devices though, it does come with a dongle to make that possible. Very thoughtful. I was further impressed by the look and feel of the machine. It feels sleek, yet durable, and it looks the same. When you pull this out of a bag or briefcase, youre going to look truly classy. This is a machine that looks as good as it is, and truly is worth every penny. Good job on this one, Del!
The new Dell New XPS 13 9300 13.4-inch UHD Infinity Edge Touchscreen Laptop is a very impressive looking and performing small laptop--at least so far.  It is a beautifully designed silver laptop with a 16:10 4-sided infinity edge display meaning there is virtually no border space wasted.  It is UHD with 3840 X 2400 pixels making the display crystal clear. It comes with all the latest bells and whistles including touchscreen, webcam, Corning Gorilla Glass 6 screen, and dual cooling fans.  The actual construction of this super thin laptop is breath catching for some--supposedly cut from solid aluminum to fit perfectly together.  It has no optical drive and uses USB-c ports. The unit is powered by a 10th generation Intel core i7 chip, contains 32g on board Ram and 2TB in storage.  So far, I have found it to be quick and easy to power up and very responsive with its Windows 10 Home OS.  I am not a gamer, so I have no comment on the reviews cautioning against using it for gaming purposes.  I have had very mixed results with Dell units in the past, but if this holds up, it will be a welcome addition to my acquisitions.  It is a sleek, well-constructed, high def machine that I recommend after only a week of using.
First the good...Great keyboard, thin, respectable graphics, love that its a high res touchscreen. Then the shortcomings...- Yes, I know its flagship, and thin, but still would like to have had at least one USB-A connector. - Doesnt take smaller chargers. I have a super small 30W charger I like to travel with. My MBP will not complain and during use, will not drain as fast if connected and take its time charging when not being used. The Dell XPS will just say no.- gets hotter than I would like and fans not as quiet as what I would expect from a flagship laptop (expert opinion).- Im trying to think of a product I have in my house with a camera that is worse than this one... and for the life of me, I cant come up with one. This includes an old Samsung phone, a generic Chinese tablet, and a 6-year-old, base model, sub $400 Lenovo Flex 3 I bought on sale. I just cant believe its this bad. I just assumed that a flagship laptop purchase would have an impressive camera and had I known it was this bad, I would have bought something else. Unfortunately, in today world and because of the apps we use, camera quality is now a top priority on laptops and pushes this laptop to the bottom of any consideration list. The Dell XPS15 9500 (2020) camera plain sucks. Light, bright light, low-light: the only safe-for-work adjective I have for it is sucks. The camera ruins it for the whole laptop. Assume you dont have one. I have yet to try the reinstall driver recommendation I read on Dells website post, but I will try that... I regret not doing my usual research and due diligence in comparing products and reading reviews before making this (very expensive) purchase. :(
This laptop is a great product. First thing you will notice is how compact it is. It fits well in any carrier you would have and leaves tons of room to spare. It weighs about 7 lbs., so it is very easy to carry and have it fit in an environment like a desk or at the side of the bed. Even with its size it is still a strong computer. With 1.5 GHz, it can run basic documents, email, browsers, files, and anything else you would need for business well. Plus, the 36 GB of storage allows for a lot of information to be saved and brought with you, if you are on the move. Another point in its favor and what makes it a great laptop is battery life. On average, you get around 6 hours of active use before it dies. You can also customize it, so if you need more battery or performance out of the laptop, it is available. One point I dislike is its lack of sub ports or any ports other than two USB-C ports and a headphone jack, but it does come with a USB-C converter, so you can plug other devices in. Overall, the laptop is perfect for someone who is constantly on the move and needs an efficient, reliable computer to bring with them that doesnt take up too much space but can hold a lot of information. It also works perfectly in an office setting.
They advertise this as a great computer for video and photo editing with a great screen and good colors but that cant be further from the truth. It has horrible banding issues and very pixilated when watching video and the colors are not accurate. Its partly due to the Dell Primer Color program that comes installed on the computer. With some research I found out it has been messing up the colors and causing banding issues and pixilation for over a year. Its a common problem on the Dell support site. Dell blames Intel, but the fact of the matter is that if you Uninstall the Dell program it gets a little better. They refuse to just acknowledge the problem and fix it though. If your using this for photo or video editing spend the extra $500 and buy a MacBook. This is unacceptable for a computer of this price that is advertised for creative work.
I dont know everything technical about this computer, but I can tell you from a regular person prospective, this works great. It is thin and light weight. I like that I can use it as a small laptop, or as a tablet. Both the touchscreen and the keyboard are quick to respond. I find the keyboard and touch pad to be comfortable to use. The computer loads quickly. It did come with some games and trial programs that easy to remove. Just right click on them and select uninstall. Its easy to research online to find whats not needed. Setting it up is as simple as signing into your Windows account if you have one. I am using this for everyday task such as emails, recipes, social media, shopping, and streaming. For that, I am very happy with this. I love that its lightweight and small enough to slip into my backpack. The sound and picture are great.
There are many configurations for notebook computers. They range from Just okay, to Incredible. This Dell machines falls into the Incredible category. The monitor is great at 3840 x 2400. This is 4K and the picture is good. I think it is better as a movie watching monster, than it is as a gaming machine. Nothing wrong, great specs, but not a top gaming machine. With 32gig of RAM and 2TB storage, this computer is fast with lots of storage. It is also compatible with the new Wi-Fi___33 standard, Wi-Fi___33 6. The shell was made from a single sheet of aluminum making this fast-little jewel easy on the eyes, too. It does not come with the old USB 1-3 port, but it does have two USB C. This is about as future-proof as one can get. This is a beautiful computer and a delight to operate. Highly recommended.
Really powerful and fast with i7, 32GB and SSD. Stunning HDR display. Its very quiet and compact. Its worth mentioning that it only has the 2 USB-C ports but thats to be expected for a thin compact notebook. We have an external multiport sub hub that takes care of that problem. The speakers are fine if not great but again for a thin, compact machine thats to be expected as well. The touch screen works as expected although with the smaller screen it might give you some trouble if you have larger hands. I dont really have a need to use the touchscreen though so its not really an issue. Battery life is decent depending on what type of activities you are doing. Startup time is quick which is no surprise with most SSD devices. It has a nice high-quality feel to it. Really a solid, fast, and impressive laptop.
This Dell laptop feels solid and high quality. It folds up to about the size of a tablet. The screen resolution is great (1920 x 1200) with a 16:10 aspect ratio. The touchscreen works well, and I have had no issues with it. However, I dont like getting fingerprints on my screen, so I dont use it often. It uses a USB-C charger that it is small and doesnt take up much room. I really like how you can plug in the charger on the left or right side. The specs are better than average. It uses an M.2 hard drive and boots up fast. I havent had problems with it overheating. I use Ubuntu 20.04, instead of Windows, too. So far, I have not had any problems or concerns. I mainly use it for programming and web browsing. Im very happy with it!
This is the most expensive computer I have ever owned in my life and it is AWESOME! The sound on this laptop is AMAZING! Its crystal clear and sounds like surround sound which is JUST AMAZING when watching movies! I dont understand the specs when it comes to computers so I cant speak to that but what I can tell you is this works fast. Its awesome for what we use it for. Online shopping, social media, streaming, email etc. etc. We do everything but online gaming. I really like it!
I was in a need of a good laptop with a good amount of storage room AND ram for regular use and creating music.  A few things I specifically liked about this laptop is the storage, the crisp display, touch screen feature, good battery life, light weight, and fast processor. A few things I didnt quite like are there are no separate buttons for right/left mouse clicking, comes with a lot of bloatware (but some could be removed), and not ideal port options for me. I noticed a lot of the reviews state that this laptop comes used. In my experience, the box that the laptop was in had a dell return label on it underneath the new label but did not appear to be used or opened so not sure what is going on.
For the price of this, this could be better. The first time using it, the battery did heat up quickly but after that first time, I didnt have that issue anymore. It took me a while to get use to because Ive been a MacBook user for years. I do love the infinity screen and the ease of using this as a tablet! I use it more as tablet form then anything. The voice to text needs some work because I am having to go back and correct a whole lot more then my MacBook or iPad. Maybe in time it will learn my speaking voice. It is quick and has enough memory for me on how Im using it. I havent found a lot of options as to cases so hopefully in time, there will be more options.
So far, the Lap top works great.  Wave had no major malfunctions.  The touch screen and mousepad work just as expected.  Getting everything set up was a breeze.  My only issue has been the webcam and speaker.  We do a lot of zoom calls and the volume doesnt get that loud.  I may hook up another speaker just to ensure I can hear out of it.  The camera doesnt seem to be the best, it suffices, it for 2k, I was hoping for A slightly better picture.
My XPS 13 cost $2800 and is less than a year old. The small rubber strip on the hinge is coming unattached and cannot be reattached. When I contacted Dell their response was, Nope. Not covered. Its a part that cannot cost more than a dollar, if that, and they will not replace it? After I spent $2,800 on the unit! Sure, they were happy to take as much of my money as they could up front and then disappeared when I had a very small issue. Just imagine how they will respond when its something crucial.
I received this product free in exchange for an honest review. I have wanted a small laptop for a while now and havent found the right one, but this one is perfect. It is a sleek silver with an elegant touchscreen and a touch pad that glides like silk under my fingertips. It is fast and while it does have the expected Microsoft bloatware, it is not enough to mar the experience overall.  It is a bit annoying to find there is no USB port, only a micro -C port that requires a dongle to provide a USB connection.  Overall, I love this product and highly recommend it.
Small problem with phone jack.  DELL Tech Support took about 4 hours to fully break the machine and then suggested that I reinstall... or something.  Customer support took 3 hang ups, 9 transfers and over 2 hours to learn that the machine was a bit over the 30 day return and so I am stuck with a trashed-out machine. I highly recommend the Apple product as they have adequate support and honor their warranty.
This is a top of the line working laptop. The touch screen is excellent, clear, and responsive. It is fast both off and online doing everything you want for a working environment. The sound is excellent, much better than I expected for this laptop. This is NOT a game laptop; you will be very disappointed if you expect mid-range games to play well.
Overall great
I came over from a Mac because apple does do not offer a touch screen two in one option and I need that now as a will be whiteboarding on remote meetings often.  I bought the 16-gig ram version of this on the Dell site, then saw this on Amazon for 50 dollars more for 32 gigs.  No Brand computer feels like a MacBook air.... which is what I needed.... except even a little better if you believe it. Im in the tech industry so I had many many computers.... this guy takes the cake.  So lightning fast.  So tiny yet the screen is big.  Its so much smaller than a MacBook Air yet it has a larger screen! Im happy with it.  Man, its fast for a machine this small.  Great buy.
I got this laptop on Saturday.  But I noticed that when I put it on charging the screen turns off completely and returns Is this a problem or how it was manufactured?
