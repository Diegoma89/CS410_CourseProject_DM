B084R4T4WD,Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Almost perfect but killer touchpad wobble. Beware of Dell support.,"Reviewed in the United States on July 18, 2020","The laptop is gorgeous but beware of the touchpad as it wobbles and has like a false click when you're using it; this is by now a known issue and my unit was affected by it. I'm evaluating my replacement options right now but it seems it's hard to get an unit without this or worse issues.Update1: Dell wants to replace the part with an on-site technician visit but they are backordered. Will update this review if this works.Update2: Almost 30 days after purchase and 20 days since contacting support Dell has not scheduled the technician visit as the order is backordered. Beware when buying this laptop, a lot of them present this issue.Update3: I have received 3 units of this laptop so far (two replacements). The QA is really bad, they all had touchpad or screen issues, the latest one having flex to click issues (google: ""flex to click xps 9500""). BTW the technician visit on update2 was never scheduled and the ETA was moved up twice. If you're picky with touchpads or quality of your purchases don't buy this model. Reducing my review to one star."

B084R4T4WD,ALY,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastic machine. Delivered as promised,"Reviewed in the United States on June 25, 2020","I was a little nervous reading reviews that stated that computers come used, not working etc. I can confirm that Amazon delivered to me a pristine machine - working perfectly, is new and exactly to the spec Amazon advertised. Very happy with the purchase. I purchased UHD+ Touchscreen 10th gen i7 - the screen is perfect, on par or better than new MacBook Pro that I also use. Overall new XPS 15 is well designed, solid machine with fast processor and outstanding UHD+ screen. I also like that I can upgrade it to 64GB or RAM for about $300 (2933MHz DDR4 CL17 SODIMM Laptop Memory).P.S. For non technical people, please run both Dell updater (lots of drivers / bios updates there) and Windows updates."
B084R4T4WD,Bryan,4.0 out of 5 stars,THE BEST WINDOWS LAPTOP OF 2020!,"Reviewed in the United States on August 6, 2020","This laptop is fantastic, and overall I am very satisfied with this purchase.  But let's talk about the elephant in the room that a few reviewers have already pointed out: ""Is this a new product?"".  Given the $2000 price tag, it's only natural to be concerned about the integrity of the product you are receiving.  I understand that entirely as I was very concerned myself.For me, the laptop itself was inside its original packaging and showed no signs of being opened before.  With that said, the box was a little banged up upon arrival.  The laptop itself was wrapped around plastic, and everything inside seemed in place.Now, there is a shipping label on the original packaging box from ""Dell Returns"" located in Lebanon, Tennessee.  So I did some quick investigating.  I read that most returns for Dell products will get shipped to this Return Center in Lebanon, Tennessee.  These returns include order cancellations and unopened returns.  Dell Outlet, in turn, sells these ""new unused"" products at a cheaper price tag.  So yes, I believe this product is ""NEW"", but it is new under the Dell Outlet standards.  This is just my assumption but is the most logical reason I can think of.For me, I have no problem receiving a Dell Outlet product, but it should at least be advertised as such on Amazon.  Now, considering all of these factors and even if this is a Dell Outlet product, getting a Dell XPS 15 (2020 model) at this price (~$2000) is a STEAL!  You are getting Dell's UHD+ touchscreen infinity display, latest i7 CPU, 1 TB of SSD storage, and Windows 10 Pro.  If you were buying this same laptop configuration off of Dell's official website, it run you close to ~$2500.  On top of the cheaper price tag on Amazon, there is a 10% back for customers who purchase this laptop on a Amazon Prime Visa card (~$200 back).The laptop itself has solid specs and is built very solidly.  The aluminum casing and carbon fiber finish gives this laptop a premium feel.  The display is gorgeous and crisp.  The touchscreen is super responsive.  The track pad is honestly the best I have experienced on any Windows laptop.  I personally have NOT had the wobbly track pad issue some users were having.Some issues I do have with the laptop is that it does heat up quite a bit, and you can hear the fans spinning pretty hard at times. Dell has a weird adaptive brightness feature, but you can easily turn this off in the settings.  Battery life is less than impressive when you are doing more intensive tasks.  I hear the pre-installed McAfee software plays a role in draining the battery, so you could disable it and use the built-in Windows Defender.  And while I love the carbon fiber finish (because it gives it an even more premium feel), it is definitely a fingerprint magnet lol.All in all, this laptop is absolutely stunning.  The amount of features you receive for the price that you buy this laptop at outweighs the minor issues that I have pointed out."
B084R4T4WD,Victor Karthik,1.0 out of 5 stars,Warning,"Reviewed in the United States on August 14, 2020","I was very excited to receive this laptop. It was a total disappointment.When I started, there was a squeaking fan noise. The noise is good enough to annoy. Then the keyboard is too warm to feel you uncomfortable.I called customer care. They asked me to upgrade bios. After upgrading, fan noise reduced and squeaky noise vanished. However, keyboard was too warm. Even after cooling down, when I try to open, it gives the uncomfortable heat to the keyboard.Why do you even sell a laptop with bios not upgraded and defects?Return service also disappointing. I returned in Aug 6 (on the same day i received). As of Aug 14, I haven't received. customer service told, it will take 2 more weeks to refund. Bad experience. I will never buy a laptop in Amazon. It would have been easier on a local bestbuy"
B084R4T4WD,Simon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing little beast. Performance and Size are priority,"Reviewed in the United States on August 3, 2020","Battery is outstanding if you compare to ""any"" product of this size. I know specs and read reviews but let me tell you this is your go to laptop for mobility, performance, and work.Let's be clear... no graphics card. 1080p screen.... and crunched space is noticeable. (WHAT WOULD YOU EXPECT FROM A LAPTOP THAT IS 8""x11"")If you care about screen bleeding... my question is how you want a bright screen and 1/4"" screen frame?If you care about keyboard space then you are better off with bigger products.This product is made to perform... that is not compromised. Fast wifi, fast processor,  fast ram.If this makes you happy... look no further"
B084R4T4WD,Brian Hunter,3.0 out of 5 stars,Pretty OK Lappy,"Reviewed in the United States on July 25, 2020","I bought this laptop for music storage, social media, surfing and storage and editing photography.  I don't do any graphic intensive games, so no comment there.GOOD: I do like the screen size and image quality, touch screen, storage, RAM, keyboard, SSD startup times, backlit keyboard and slim design.  I think the price is consistent with those features.  It set up pretty easily.  Its slim.  It seems quick.  If not listed below, I suppose I'm happy with it.BAD: - Screen brightness change.  This freaked me out until I went online and found how to disable the adaptive screen.  I need a consistent accurate screen editing my pics.  Even disabled, I still see a brightness change slightly after I load an image.  I've done two support chats with mixed experiences.  I'll forward and check the images to see if my editing is accurate.  If so, I suppose I can live with the pause.- Oven.  I actually use the laptop in my lap.  I almost cannot use it plugged in due to the heat.  It needs better cooling.  Looking on-line, this seems to be a Dell design issue on some models.  The solution list, other than keeping it lint free, are all about non-lap surfaces and maybe cooling pads.  Um.  No.- Ports.  While its a little nice to be able to charge from either side, these little ports basically work with no USB/HDMI/SD without adapters.  There are 2 little ports that can charge or use an included adapter to USB.  There's a micro SD that fits none of my existing camera SD cards.  If I'm charging and cooking my lap, I can use the USB adapter for one accessory.  Very limiting and adapters are an expensive hassle to my exiting blue-toothless devices.On balance, for the money, I would say the features balanced by issues makes it pretty OK.  I can't compare it to competition, but I'd say if you use it for long in your lap for photography editing.. and you have full size SD cards.. check out the competition."
B084R4T4WD,Verified Buyer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Not sure what's more defective, the computer or Dell tech support","Reviewed in the United States on August 16, 2020","After updating the recommended audio driver from dell site, audio no longer worked. After 45 minutes of handing the system over to dell tech support, computer was bricked! ""Sorry for the inconvenience"" was their response. Really? Needless to say, I won't be replacing this one with a dell computer.PS Dell, why don't you hire Americans for work from home technical support?"
B084R4T4WD,Allen Roy,5.0 out of 5 stars,My First DELL & I M happy,"Reviewed in the United States on August 10, 2020","I am a heavy user, multitasking most of the time with applications and screens. Wanted a compact laptop with high RAM, found this. I am very very happy with the performance, the battery.. Only wished it to have some more USB sockets and provision for sim card onboard. Overall a very good and elegant product."
B084R4T4WD,Christopher Edie,5.0 out of 5 stars,Impressive for creative work not gaming.,"Reviewed in the United States on October 30, 2020","Dell XPS 15 9500This is a magnificent 15.6 in laptop created for the creative professional. It is capable of gaming but does not accel in that field. The version I selected has the following hardware:- i7 10750H- GTX 1650 ti- 16GB RAM- 1TB SSD-86 WHr battery (good for 8-9 hours of normal internet surfing)Appearance:-The dimensions of this laptop are: H= .71” (18mm) W= 13.57” (344.72mm) D= 9.06” (230.14mm). It is 4.5 lbs (2.05 kg).-The chassis is made of CNC aluminum. The dell logo in the center of the lid is glossy.-The palm wrest is a soft black carbon fiber with a touchpad is 5.9” x3.5” which is similar to that of a MacBook.Display-The laptop has a 16:10 infinity-edge display. This means that where are almost no bezels on this screen at all. My model has a 3840x2400 screen with VESA certifiedHDR400 sporting a 500nit display. It has 100% Adobe RGB and 94% DCI-P3 color gamut.GTG so finishing quickly:Features:-Windows hello (facial recognition)-Finger print scanner-720p camera on top of display-nice IO with 2 thunderbolt 3 ports on the left along with a Kensington lock slot and on the right a USB-C with charging capabilities, a headphone jack and a SD card slot on the right.-The laptop comes with an adapter allowing you to use an HDMI or USB-type A device.-laptop has WiFi and Bluetooth connectivity***Note***-The first batch of this product had a touchpad wobble that may also click unintentionally. Mine did not have this issue.-The McAfee free antivirus that comes with the computer greatly increases the drain of battery life. I recommend removal."
B084R4T4WD,Mark,1.0 out of 5 stars,DONT use it plugged in on your lap or overnight,"Reviewed in the United States on August 16, 2020","DONT PUT IT ON YOUR LAP WHILE CHARGING. When plugged in the laptop becomes one step away from a fire hazard.  It gets extremely  hot. To the point I won't leave it plugged overnight not open and near a fan.Other than that its a nice computer. Runs great for photo editing,  not for gaming. Tends to crash even with early 2000 games, especially when plugged in when it Will overheat."
B084R4T4WD,Larry Bradley,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this laptop,"Reviewed in the United States on August 18, 2020","I'm an IT guy so having a machine that is powerful but agile is important to me.  I upped the RAM to 32Gb of DDR4-2933.  Since it does not do XMP, DDR4-3200 will not run full speed.  But that's OK by me, it performs great.  I'm glad I waited for the Windows Hello camera built-in.  Make sure you have USB-C devices or adapters for other peripherals.  It does come with one adapter also.  You won't go wrong with this laptop."
B084R4T4WD,Richard C.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fast and easy to travel with.,"Reviewed in the United States on August 1, 2020","Love this laptop! Fast, great touchscreen and lightweight. Could use more than two ports but beyond that it's great."
B084R4T4WD,Zabed Monika,4.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent hardware and Dell customer service; some glitches with drivers and Windows 10,"Reviewed in the United States on November 7, 2020","Overall, I am very happy with my Dell XPS 13 9300. The trackpad and touchscreen have excellent sensitivity, the webcam and keyboard are of much higher quality than my previous laptop (admittedly, a much cheaper Lenovo Ideapad) and the screen resolution and color reproduction, while not world-beating, are more than adequate for all but artists and graphic designers.Having 16gb of RAM has made a huge difference in running multiple browser tabs. As a middle school teacher working remotely, I need at least 20 tabs running simultaneously to teach a class online, several with videos queued up. Gone are the awkward delays and freeze-ups that would sometimes plague my previous 8gb machine.I should certainly mention that my XPS 13 stopped working entirely after 8 days - so why the four-star review? I couldn't have been more impressed with both Dell and Amazon customer service; the prompt return calls, careful attention, allowing me plenty of options (repair or replacement) and ultimately replacing my laptop the very next day. It's a fact of life that complex machines can break; it's what happens after that in my opinion is most important.So, why not five stars? This new computer comes with the latest version of Windows 10, which is far more intrusive than I've experienced before. For example, there is no way to stop Cortana spying on you, disengaging Skype has become much harder, and installing the latest Dell drivers was made more challenging, in part because of changes to Windows firewall and bios. Specifically, it took almost two days of troubleshooting to diagnose and remedy an issue with the speaker driver - during which I was without sound.Nevertheless, my overall impressions have been very favorable and wholeheartedly recommend this laptop."
B084R4T4WD,Erica C,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Laptop,"Reviewed in the United States on August 28, 2020","This is a great laptop for students. I am an engineering student, and I wanted a Windows laptop because iOS can’t run some of the programs I am using. This laptop provides that and much more. I am incredibly impressed by the battery life. I definitely recommend. Also, I was kind of hesitant in buying a laptop from Amazon, but it arrived fast and in great condition."
B084R4T4WD,Francisco,2.0 out of 5 stars,Great Laptop Horrible Charger,"Reviewed in the United States on October 13, 2020","I was looking to get a high end machine like this one for long time, its an slim, classy and super cool laptop. Small, great for traveling, super expensive. Why provide a charger that can not last more that 6 months, I am typing this review on a 3 year old machine from their biggest competitor, 4 times less expensive laptop, the original charger my of this model just died due to extreme traveling and the wire broker, so this new new one 45 W super good looking charger cant last at least 6 months. Amazon is doing their best, they are online with me and the company appears to be inclined to ship a new adaptor, I am on call for 31+ minutes...Amazon customer service is on the call, their service 10. Factory just rambling...and transfer call around...I purchase the extended warranty from Amazon so I now it will taken care eventually, glad I kept the old laptop, and since most of my work is inside Dropbox, until Dell sends the replacement charger under warranty, I am not dead in the water. BUYER BEWARE !!!!"
B084R4T4WD,JB,4.0 out of 5 stars,Overall happy with this (XPS 15/9500) so far!,"Reviewed in the United States on October 27, 2020","I rarely take the time to write reviews, but this is a big ticket item for most people.I have nothing bad to say regarding the particular XPS 9500 unit I received with a couple of caveats...The Bad:Similar to other reviewers, I suspect this product is not ""NEW"" as described but rather returned and/or refurbished. It came in a rather torn up box which was simply sealed with regular packing tape. It was shipped to Amazon from a company that appears to be an authorized reseller/or refurbishing center as far as I could tell from a quick Google search. The box had certainly been around the block a time or two, LOL.Given the price point and specs, I'm not surprised if it is a ""refurb, open box, return, etc."" I'm only surprised that Amazon sells them at a steep discount but describes as ""NEW"". I could be way off base here, and perhaps Dell ships most of their products in beat up boxes, and I'm just unaware of it.The Good:I know the above sounded very critical, but bear with me. Once I opened the outer box, the inner Dell box was pristine. Everything was nicely packaged and appeared brand new. The usual protective plastic peel off, unwrap, etc. stuff was all there on everything. There wasn't a fingerprint or speck of dust to be found.  Even smelled ""like new"". So...I figured I'd give it a go. Set it up and everything seemed fine, so I opened it up and upgraded memory to 64gb. Everything internally looked new to my untrained eye as well.  I've been using it for several days with no issues. Overall, I personally am happy for the price, but if these aren't truly ""new"", I think description should reflect that.Considerations:My laptop before this one was an XPS 15 2012 or 2013 model. It originally had Windows 8 on it FWIW. I had upgraded to SSD, switched to Win10, maxed out RAM, and replaced battery over the years...Just so you know my basis for comparison.Other reviews on both Amazon and online mention crackling speakers and faulty trackpads with this model.  My experience has been that speakers sound as good as any laptop I've ever heard, and trackpad is slightly less sensitive in top corners but otherwise fine (I never would have noticed trackpad thing except for online reviews had me looking for faults.) I personally find the speakers and trackpad perfectly fine. Another criticism has been loud fan noise when laptop is trying to cool.  It doesn't bother me because my old XPS sounds like a turbo spooling up when it's under a load too! Maybe other brands are quieter, IDK. Fan noise wasn't a big concern of mine.Perhaps mine was a return/refurb that had faults addressed, I just got lucky and got a good unit, or the faults aren't as bad as they are made out to be with this model. I can't say for certain, but that's my experience thus far and honest review."
B084R4T4WD,John,1.0 out of 5 stars,Buy at Your Own Risk,"Reviewed in the United States on October 25, 2020","I've included the laptop configuration to be sure. I saw one review unrelated to this specific laptop in the mix.New Dell XPS 15 9500 15.6 inch UHD+ Touchscreen Laptop (Silver) Intel Core i7-10750H 10th Gen, 16GB DDR4 RAM, 1TB SSD, Nvidia GTX 1650 Ti with 4GB GDDR6, Window 10 Pro (XPS9500-7845SLV-PUS)I received my laptop on 10/1. But I was too nervous about opening the package after having read several negative reviews about the trackpad. Finally, I opened the box a few days later because I was curious to see what I had bought.Like in several other reports, the first thing I noticed was the Dell returns label. So that was the first red flag. And just for that, I was ready to seal the box and send it back. But then I decided to check out the trackpad. If it turned out to be okay, then I would keep the machine.After powering on the laptop, I tested the trackpad in every way possible by pressing and clicking. I wanted to know if I would get the wobble or rattle effect that others have experienced. I didn't. But as I tested out the trackpad, I noticed something else--the erratic cursor movement.No matter how hard I tried moving the cursor, it had a mind of its own. It would not go in the directions I wanted. So I quickly Googled and found that it was also another issue others have reported. One even mentioned Dell sending a technician to replace the trackpad.I don't have an issue buying a ""refurbished"" laptop, given that the seller had stated in the descriptions clearly. But Dell wasn't willing to do that, of course. They needed to rid as many of the problematic units as possible. I knew the price was too low to be true. I had even compared it with the same configuration on Dell's website.Too bad. The laptop even got the thumbs up from many YouTube reviewers as one of the top-notch video editing computers. I didn't have the time to look for other potential flaws. So I packaged it the same day and sent it back.I finally received my refund nearly three weeks later. Not sure why it took that long to process. I vaguely remember someone else mentioning the slow refund as well.Dell has lost my confidence in buying their laptops online. So off to the other reputable sellers I go!"

B084R4T4WD,Amazin Products,3.0 out of 5 stars,LCD gave out on me after 3 months!!,"Reviewed in the United States on October 7, 2020","I bought the XPS 13 9300 touchscreen. I wanted to go big because everyone reviewed how this ultrabook was the best in 2020. The laptop was great. It was very light and compact. I use it for my college classes and watch my daily videos.One day, I suddenly I get 7 white flashes and 2 amber flashes that constantly repeated on the laptop's battery source. I restarted the laptop and my display does not work (pitch black). However, it does work when you connect it to an external display. I did a lot of research and tried to fix the software, but apparently the LCD gave out on me. I was very disappointed, especially since this ultrabook was not cheap."
B084R4T4WD,trev,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect Machine,"Reviewed in the United States on October 20, 2020","I don't normally write reviews, but I just wanted to report that this machine came in absolutely perfect. No touchpad issues, nothing negative whatsoever. I am highly critical of laptops, being a cloud architect. I can detect absolutely nothing wrong with this piece. I was highly concerned that the touchpad would wobble etc but nope, perfect. It's the first touchpad I've ever used that rivals a MacBook. It's actually big enough to perform the three and four-finger gestures that are now built in to windows 10. Touchscreen is sublime. Keyboard: no complaints. It's just great all around."

So I was nervous to trust Dell again.  But after a few months of using this device I find it to be rock solid.

But overall I'm impressed.Pro's:-Light, small footprint, but still a large display-Can be obtained without annoying touch screen!-Support for MS Hello is an unexpected pleasure-Great keyboard for old-school touch typists!-Blazing Fast-Support 32GB of RAM for VMsCon's:-Weak graphics (you won't be playing games on this laptop)-USB-C only, but it's the new world-It's so darned pretty I worry it will get stolen?I haven't experienced the heat others have, then again I don't sit it on my lap much.  The fans do run a lot, but they are very quiet IMO. The only disappointment is the graphics. Reviews implied you could do basic gaming using Intel Iris.  I haven't found that to be true.  But the fact I can run two VM's simultaneously and still be productive on my main OS, makes this an ultra-mobile powerhouse for me. It's why the seeming regression in CPU isn't listed as a con.  And in the end this is a work machine, not a gaming rig.I can't comment on battery life yet."

B084R4T4WD,M. Hill,4.0 out of 5 stars,Dell XPS 13  2-in-1 Convertible Windows Laptop/Tablet,"Reviewed in the United States on July 3, 2020","Overall this is a high performance 2-in-1 laptop/tablet with some impressive features. It is fashioned from a single piece of aluminum which creates a solid quality feel.  The high definition Gorilla glass display is also a response touchscreen--and the very thin border increases actual screen-size.Performance is lightning fast and reliable. It is quiet while operating and remains cool.  Using Wi-Fi 6 means a faster wireless speed which I noticed when transferring files over my network and running software remotely.  And, when connected to a compatible external drive the Thunderbolt 3 ports provide impressively quick access.The laptop/tablet is close to perfect but there are a couple minor items that could be better.  For example it only has two USB C ports one of which is usually required for power (the battery fully charged lasts approximately 4 hours) which leaves only one open port for a peripheral device. A Thunderbolt 3 hub may be a wise choice to optimize the machine’s top performance.Finally, setting up the fingerprint sensor is the usual tedious process but I found performance inconsistent so I end up using another login option.  Otherwise this is an elegant easy-to-use, high-performance machine. If interested details are noted below.Setup. It arrived fully-charged and when opened t began the Windows 10 Home Edition voice-based installation requesting things like language, location, Wi-Fi name and password. If already possessing a Windows account it uses previously established settings. Otherwise an account will need to be set up or bypassed by setting up a local user.Be aware that it will automatically install a third-party security program on a free three month trial basis unless the option is unchecked. And even though I unchecked the option the prompt appeared with every restart until I uninstalled it in Windows. Other trial software automatically installed includes Office 365, Netflix, Dropbox, Candy Crush and Farm Heroes Saga--the user can decide whether to uninstall.After the Windows setup is complete the Dell setup begins which strongly recommended the installation of 9 updated drivers. I had to re-run it three times and it periodically re-booted during the process.  This is part of a Dell suite of included software that automatically updates software and drivers on the machine unless the user opts out.Other parts of the suite include a Power Manager, a Mobile Connect which allows access to a smartphone, Cinema Guide for subscribing to screening services and Digital Delivery for ordering s wide range of software like Microsoft Office.The HD webcam built into the top edge of the bezel is so small the standard webcam covers I have on-hand are all too big. The webcam has a white LED indicator light so it is obvious when in use. The keyboard has large keys, no numeric keypad and it is subtly back-lit.In addition to the two Thunderbolt 3 ports the laptop/tablet has a 3.5mm headphone port and a SD micro slot. Included is a USB C to USB A adapter and a two-piece USB C AC adapter."
B084R4T4WD,TWL50,3.0 out of 5 stars,Multiple hardware issues keep this from being a AAA laptop,"Reviewed in the United States on August 9, 2020","UPDATE: October 4, 2020 - It took Dell 2 moths but they have replaced my XPS 9500 with a new unit. A week later and I haven't had a hardware failure. In fact, this machine runs great. The battery life is still bad at less than 4 hours under low usage including web browser, and stuff like Word, and a little photoshop, with screen brightness at about 60%. Having that gorgeous 4K screen comes with a price. So overall this is a very nice laptop that wants to compete with Apple. The differences are that a macbook is going to provide superior battery life and customer service. Still, if you need a good Windows 10 laptop for graphics work, this is a pretty good. Provided it doesn't start breaking the day after you take it out of the box.UPDATE: September 12, 2020 - Over a month after receiving the XPS 9500, this laptop still is not working correctly. Since having the sound daughterboard, and then the entire motherboard and the upper deck to fix a touchpad wobble problem, the bluetooth does not work, and the wireless is so weak I have to be a few feet from a wireless router. The last tech said that the antenna was probably damaged when the first tech worked on the laptop.3 weeks ago I requested that Dell replace the laptop since it's obviously a lemon. They have done nothing but give me the runaround since. I took another star off because this laptop is not worth the price or the hassle.Needless to say, I'm really disappointed with Dell and their support.UPDATE: August 20, 2020 - The Dell XPS 9500 saga continues. 2 weeks after reporting a sound hardware failure, Dell sent a tech out to replace sound daughter board and touchpad since the touchpad it shipped with wobbled, double clicked instead of single clicked, and there was a 1"" dead space down the center.The tech spent an hour taking the laptop apart and putting the new parts in. The fix didn't work. The tech said it was because the sound amplifier was probably dead, so he ordered a new motherboard. At this point, there's no denying that this laptop is a lemon.I called Dell to see if they would replace the laptop. I was transferred between departments 3 or 4 times, and finally reached someone in warranty support. I had to jump through a lot of hoops, including sending a picture of the back of the laptop and power supply with the serial numbers showing, and the support number, plus my name and date. So weird.The request has to go to yet another department to determine if they will flat out replace the laptop with a new one. If approved they will send it in 15 to 30 days. I have had this machine for 3 weeks and it worked perfectly for 2 of those days.Oh. The tech screwed up the Bluetooth antenna so now I can't connect BT headphones at all.Original Review:BOTTOM LINE: Sound died 2 days after arriving because of a hardware failure. Touchpad is a mess. It wobbles, double clicks, and sometimes gets stuck in only right click mode. This is an awfully expensive laptop with too many issues to qualify for a recommendation.IN THE BOX: The laptop arrived in a large black box that had been doubled taped - I'm not sure if it was opened and closed again. The laptop itself was in a plastic wrap that was on wrong, so when I grasped the piece to lift the laptop, it instead opened, and the laptop fell back into the box. I suspect this was a repackaged laptop, however; the laptop looked flawless. It booted as soon as I opened the lid and didn't have to be plugged in for initial boot like most Windows 10 laptops. I don't know for sure if this is a used and repackaged laptop, but from other's experiences, I suspect it was.OPERATION: Initially, I was blown away by the laptop except for the touchpad. The screen is stunning. At 4K, it's one of the sharpest laptop screens I've ever seen. I've used MacBook Pro's for years, so this isn't exactly a recent phenomenon, just one that is new to me on windows 10 laptop.The specs are solid with a core i7, 16 gigs of ram and a fast 1 TB SSD drive. I installed a second SSD drive and for 2 days the laptop ran like a dream with one exception. It comes with Windows 10 Pro, and while there is some bloatware, I was able to remove most of it, including McAfee, without issue.Battery life is okay. In real world use, that is with screen brightness at about 65%, and performance set to ""better battery"" I get between 3 and 5 hours of use. Doing anything that taxes the laptop can drop that to 2 hours. I loaded Europa Universalis 4, and it lasted for about an hour and a half. If you need this for business use and were hoping to get something close to 8 hours, you need to look for a different laptop.There isn't anything out there like a MacBook's touchpad. It's large, responsive, and you can easily use it like a mouse. Dell has the large part down, but the touchpad has a weird double click issue, it wobbles, and sometimes it gets stuck in a weird mode where I can't scroll without the cursor zipping all over the screen, and every attempt to touch the pad results in the equivalent of a right click.Less than 48 hours after the laptop arrived the sound died, and I got a red X next to the speaker icon on the task bar. Having spent 20+ years in IT, I thought I would be able to fix it with drivers. After a day of attempting to fix the issue that included restoring the laptop to factory via a fresh Windows 10 reinstall, it still wouldn't work. 2 hours on the phone with Dell support resulted in them letting me know that a tech would be dispatched to my home within one business day with a new touchpad and data board. Cool. I can deal with that.Three days later I still have not heard anything from Dell so I called support and asked when the tech would arrive. I was then informed that the parts were back ordered, and it would be a month before they could fix the laptop. Frustrating.I've stopped using this laptop until it can be serviced, because I don't trust it for anything of a professional nature since I don't trust it not to break again. I was in the middle of writing this review when the touchpad flaked again, and I had to restart.The laptop does have a gorgeous display, and it's touchscreen, but I wonder who uses a touch screen on a device like this. The display is so sharp every time I touch it, I have the urge to break out the polishing cloth and clean away fingerprints. You can have the best hardware specs in the world, but if the computer doesn't work, what's the point in purchasing it?I'll update the review once it's been serviced and I've had a chance to give it a few weeks of real-world use. For now, I recommend looking elsewhere for a laptop. Frankly, the Acer 2 in 1 I've been using for the last 5 weeks is half the price of this laptop, works wonderfully, and I can do 8 hours of work without a single issue."
B084R4T4WD,Rich P,4.0 out of 5 stars,Outstanding Ultrabook In Every Respect But The Battery,"Reviewed in the United States on July 14, 2020","The Dell XPS 13 with the MacBook Air are the standards for ultrabook excellence.  My work laptop is this, and I appreciate the thin design, the fast processing, and the battery life.  This laptop has a touchscreen which does drain the battery, but this is notably faster and better put together than most.The onboard interfaces are excellent with a tactile feedback and lighted keyboard and responsive trackpad.  The camera in this version is front center (not the old nostril camera in the older models).  The bezel is extremely thin with good screen real estate and brightness.  The touchscreen works with both hands and light gloves and has a very good precise pointer placement if you use a stylus.  The speakers are passable, but it still retains a legacy 3.5 aux port.  This is charged with a USB-C and the chargers are smart and work with the Dell Power Manager system to extend battery life.Even using Dell Power Manager, this particular iteration does not get more than 9 hours under normal use which is beneath the usual 14 hours of the non-touch versions.  I have fully charged and discharged the battery daily for about three weeks and that is the overall average (the low was 4.5 hours under heavy video play and 12 hours idle with Dell Adaptive on).  This is much less than the non-touch screen Dell XPS 13, and I wonder if this is a combination of a battery and motherboard coordination issue.  Whatever the case, the battery life in this version is definitely beneath the normal standard compared with my own work laptop but still more than a usual workday.I would highly recommend this laptop if you must have a touchscreen with your ultrabook, but if you do not need a touchscreen, I recommend you to get the standard XPS 13 for another 8 hours of battery life."
B084R4T4WD,R. Song,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent for those who need a small powerful laptop,"Reviewed in the United States on July 3, 2020","PACKAGING: Very giftable. This computer comes in a beautiful sturdy black box with a magnetic closure. The box looks like it was designed for expensive jewelry.  If you are looking for a graduation gift, this would be very nice.SIZE: This laptop is as small as it is advertised to be.WEIGHT: Heavier than you would expect. Not so heavy that it is a burden to carry, but heavy enough so that you can feel it is durable.DISPLAY/WEBCAM: Awesome display! Love it! Great for video calls, movies, web-surfing, etc...SPEAKERS: Impressive for the size of the device.SPEED/POWER: Not so great for video games, but plenty for everything else.KEYBOARD: Too small. The keyboard is as big as it can be given the laptop's small size, but too small if you have to type a lot.MOUSEPAD: Good size, works fine.TOUCHSCREEN: Good response time. Touching the screen does leave fingerprints but you don't see them until they are really bad.PORTS: 2 USB-C ports, a microSD card read and a 3.5mm Headphone/Microphone Combo Jack. Some more ports would be nice.ACCESSORIES NEEDED: For streaming, I had to get a USB-C to HDMI cable. Then I got a BT mouse and keyboard. I recommend BT accessories when you can get them so you won't need to use as many USB-C ports. Basically anything you want to do, you'll need a USB-C to <whatever> converter to do it. If you don't have WiFi, get a USB-C to Ethernet, etc... This does include a USB-C to USB cable.Overall this is a great little laptop. Dell squeezed a lot in this small package and it wasn't full of bloatware either - another bonus. This is going to be our streaming laptop at home and our travel laptop when we travel."
B084R4T4WD,Gunnar Vogtmann ,4.0 out of 5 stars,Has Top Wanted Features,"Reviewed in the United States on June 29, 2020","The features it has was as if it was personalized just for me. A very calm voice took me through the process of things that Dell knew I was going to need help on with setups in different categories. It’s a very solid device and has been engineered for multiple ways to use it. The frame is made from a solid piece of lightweight aluminum metal with everything else attached to it. It looks and feels solid in my hands and when opening and closing the laptop the resistance is just enough. It’s not to easy or hard, it’s just right in the sweet spot that makes it flow. The keys are fluid and respond to my touch, and I’ve not had to backtrack because a key didn’t respond when I touched it while writing text. The keys are backlit for evenings and I can and already have used it propped up in bed. The adjustable light for the thirteen point four inch screen makes it so I can avoid disturbing my better half right next to me. It’s quiet enough that it’s fans can be heard but are just not enough to start annoying someone and waking them up. The machine flies through tasks at a very modest speed and having multiple apps open don’t faze it one bit. The drawing app that I (With no fuss at all) installed whisks through tasks at blinding speed that my older laptop wished it could. What a difference in a few years of what technology can do. So far I’m impressed with every aspect of this well made and consistently reliable laptop but I know I have only scratched the surface of it’s awesome power and capabilities. I’ll be updating for sure because as I always say time will tell the tale on quality and longevity of a item. FiveStars⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️!!!"
B084R4T4WD,Frankie and Chet,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Fast, smooth, and very portable - just a little awkward to open, though.","Reviewed in the United States on July 16, 2020","There's several technical reviews out there on this laptop that you can find on Wired, C/Net, and other techie magazines or whatever so I won't bore you or bother with technical aspects and just drop some pros and cons on this thing.First, I like the size. It's not a dinky 11.6 inch chromebook but it's not a massive 15incher either. I do find myself hitting the wrong button as I type and fumble-farting for the backspace key every now and then as the keyboard does feel a little small, but that's just a personal preference. The touch screen is awesome and I seriously never want to use a non-touchscreen laptop ever again. It's so much faster just to boop the screen or scroll with my finger like you would on a phone or tablet than to finagle the mouse over to the side-bar, click and hold the touchpad down as I slide my finger... it just feels slow and counterproductive now. I've had a few hiccups with the touch screen but I honestly think it was a Windows issue and not a hardware issue. In fact, I think all of my annoyances with this laptop all stem from the Windows 10 OS.I will say, though that the 2-in-1 feature is a lame gimmick. That goes for all laptops that are this way though - (again, just my opinion here) - Flipping the screen over isn't an issue - and the ""tablet mode"" kicks right in as it should and disables the keyboard, but it's so freaking awkward to hold onto it when you feel all the keys depressing under your hand - I feel like I'm going to snap all of them off or damage it some how. And then just the weight and size alone makes it feel awkward, too. It's just too cumbersome. I love the touch-screen but I won't ever use it in tablet mode. I do like that it flexes around though, so if my 3 year old gets a hold of it and folds the screen all the way around, it won't snap it or break wires inside or anything.The build quality of it is great too - but I mean, you get what you pay for, so it better be at the price point for this thing! The only issue I have with the body, which some other reviewers have mentioned, is that it's hard to actually open the lid/screen. It's got this weird ""over-bite"" thing going on to where it over hangs the lower half/keyboard by like a quarter inch or so.  That doesn't sound bad, but the leading edge is tapered so when you hold it, you don't have anything to grab to pull the two halves apart. That probably doesn't make much sense but I'll just say it's really awkward and clumsy feeling just opening the thing up.The specs are amazing but I can't take full advantage of the core i7 because my internet sucks so any lag in processing is likely from that and not the CPU. I haven't loaded anything really graphics-heavy like photoshop or anything onto this yet but I will soon... The screen is crisp and bright and I'm really liking this laptop so far. As a side note, my I.T. nerd at work says to go with Dell and Asus when it comes to laptops - he says the build quality and components are better.  I also like that Dell is a US based company and mainly builds their computers in Texas and Ireland."
B084R4T4WD,IWYWH,2.0 out of 5 stars,See attached photo,"Reviewed in the United States on August 31, 2020","I've used Dell products for several years and have trusted them for the quality.But that changed with this laptop.First, it took forever to charge out of the box. The charger is alright, but it's perplexing as to why it doesn't tell you when the laptop is fully charged. What is the purpose of the light on the tip then?But the main issue is the system itself.I wanted this laptop to use for a new job. Despite having a nice Dell desktop pc and a 15-inch Dell laptop, I wanted to use the 9300 just for the new job, nothing else. So when I used a video conferencing app, the screen suddenly went berserk. I posted a photo and it stayed like that for the entire call. I could still hear people talking and all, but I was afraid to shut the laptop down, since it was my first day and it would raise eyebrows if I suddenly ""left"" the call/meeting. During all this, the laptop itself was extremely hot. It seems to have a poor (or nonexistent) cooling system.After the meeting ended, I restarted the laptop and updated everything (BIOs, firmwares, etc). And despite doing so, the screen went berserk again during the second video call/meeting. But after holding the power button, the screen returned to normal. The system was still overheating though.So after it happened twice, I stopped using the video function on the video conferencing app, and had to join the meetings with audio only. I updated the system with whatever Dell released through SupportAssist, but am hesitant to use the laptop.  Extremely disappointed with Dell and wondering how such a product could have been released without more testing.."
B084R4T4WD,Lisa Marie,4.0 out of 5 stars,Beautiful machine but not without faults,"Reviewed in the United States on August 10, 2020","The model I received was the i7-10750H 10th Gen, 16GB DDR4 RAM, 1TB SSD, Nvidia GTX 1650 Ti with 4GB GDDR6, Window 10 Pro.Right off the bat, I loved this came with Windows 10 Pro. As a work computer, there are some settings I can't change unless I am on the pro version of windows, so the average user might not benefit from that but I very much appreciated it. This is a ""creators edition"" laptop, so it suits the majority of my needs as an instructional designer, especially with the fact that some editing software is included as a trial.Pros:- the screen is amazing and responsive- will easily run games like Final Fantasy XIV (benchmark was 12,000 on HIGH)- palm rest feels amazing and allows for pretty responsive typing- included in the box is a mini hub, which has an HDMI and USB-A port- turns on and is ready to go when the laptop is opened- i7 10th generation and the graphics card make this future-proof for the next 2-3 yearsCons:- 1tb SSD is overkill and drives up the cost of the computer (save money and get half that size)- the track pad is so uncomfortable to use- took 3 days of updating to have the computer up and functioning - some applications (like Chrome) have some issues still and crash- the battery life on max battery saver, doing internet browsing, lasts about 4 hours on a full charge- charging is done by a 130-Watt Type-C 3-Prong AC Adapter - a regular USB-C cable will not charge this- ONLY HAS USB-C ports - to really get the most out of this computer, invest in a thunderbolt 3-USB-C docking station (the downside is a good one will run $150 or more)Overall, the cons outweighed the pros for me on the XPS, which is why I gave it 4 stars. While impressive as a creator's edition computer, beyond that, it doesn't feel like a 5 star computer, especially with the track pad and the necessity of needing a docking station.***When considering a computer and the price, I always look at the price and then how many years I can expect to get out of it and then use that as a guide to see if the computer is worth it to purchase for that price per year. The 2020 Dell XPS 15 should be a reliable machine with components that won't age out technologically for 3 years or so. Considering that and the retail price of the model, I don't think this is worth $700 a year, if it even lasts 3 years for my job as an instructional designer.  ***"
B084R4T4WD,Ardeal,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent Laptop for Photographers and people on the go,"Reviewed in the United States on July 8, 2020","This is one sleek Dell laptop that is easy to carry around. It is small and compact, but my favorite feature is the screen quality.  As a photographer, it is very important for me to make sure the images on screen are uniform and not distorted. The screen is better than regular High Def, as it is anti-reflective 1920 x 1200 with no distortion in luminosity from any angle due to the Corning Gorilla Glass 6, that is designed to allow touch screen. The processor is top notch and booting time is very fast, and the SSD hard-drive also helps. Although the laptop has USB-C connections at the right and left side, there is a USB-C to regular USB connector that is included separately. I was pleased that setup took just a few minutes and I was ready to go. Dell really did an outstanding job with this one - I wish my Dell work computer would be half as pretty as this one."
B084R4T4WD,Ann,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great features and a good machine!,"Reviewed in the United States on July 31, 2020","The Dell model that I received was the DELL XPS 13 –9300 with the Intel i7-1065G7 processor running a clock speed of 1.30 GHZ. The installed RAM was 32 GB and the ran the Windows 10 64 bit operating system. It was a thin ultra-light weight unit that weighed only 2.8 lbs. And The machine also had a 1920 x 1080 pixel screen with 10 touch support points. The had a 1.8 T SSD for storage.The unboxing of the machine is straight forward – no unnecessary extra packaging, and I pulled it out I was wowed right away. It is probably one best looking ultabooks I had seen. Crafted with polished aluminium and black carbon fiber palm rest. The heavy duty heavy duty hinge which can be opened with one hand!I charged the unit via the USB-C port. There are two – one on each side for which well thought of. Theincluded power adaptor had a connector with a LED light that informs the user that its charging the notebook.There is also a microphone jack and micro SD card reader . All pretty typical of machines this size. I initially hunted for the power button which is not marked. I was informed that it serves as a finger print reader too for folks that need that added security but have not tried it out, but I think it'll make it even better.The key board is superlative and well thought and the keys were very responsive with adequate spacing. The LED back lighting was a handy feature specially when u work in a darkened surrounding. The track pad was responsive and navigating was breeze. The screen was an absolute delight. Dell has implemented a 16 x10 aspect ratio in the small body with a bevel less screen.. The webcam is right on the top and very functional .Colors are  very impressive for a screen of this size. The brightness of the screen adjusts with theambient light which was a welcome feature. The screen becomes really bright and when I was using iton my balcony in the sunlight there were no issues with visiblity.The unit I received was devoid of any bloatware and it loaded up suprisingly fast for a windows machine.I installed a version of MS Office 365 and went through the apps on it. There was no lag in loading theapps and all ran really fast.Surfing the net using Chrome or Edge was really fast and web pages loaded quickly.The battery life was really a pleasant surprise. I played some movies via Netflix and the battery lastedover 10 hours. For a ultra book this size I thought it was really good.Overall the XPS 13 in my configuration was really a great experience very comparable to the MACthough I have not compared the two as yet.For someone looking for ulta light weight windows notebook with great screen , great battery life andvery reponsive to common programs the DELL XPS 13 is one great machine. Only reason to give it 4 stars instead of 5 is the lack of ports - there are only USB C ports on the device so you have to use a dongle, but they supply one (and this is no different than Apple macbooks)."
B084R4T4WD,Leopoldo Kaneeny,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Fast, gorgeous screen -- but limited ports for displays and external pointing device.","Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2020","TL;DR?-- great as a standalone laptop-- adding a mouse or external displays -- be prepared to spend (even more) money--------------------------------------------------I have to admit that I'm already used to this laptop since it is very similar (but nicer) than our standard-issue laptop from my employer.  So keyboard layout etc feels comfortable.The screen is terrific -- this is the first touchscreen I have had and not sure how much I will use it because a) I'm accustomed to trackpads and b) I'm OCD about fingerprints on my screen and this has a glossy layer that would become a fingerprint magnet.This isn't the lightest weight laptop you will find -- but it also seems more solidly built than most.  No flex in the keyboard etc so appreciate the solid and substantial feel.The bezel is EXTREMELY narrow -- if you are used to covering up your webcam, you'l be hardpressed to find a cover that won't encroach on the screen.With the specs, this is about as fast as you would expect it to be.  I""m not a gamer but can't abide ""spinny circles"" as I am working the PC.Out of the box, this does feel quite warm -- I can feel the heat through the keyboard as I am typing this.  I hope this doesn't mean that this will develop heat or thermal issues.  That said, the bottom seems to be not as warm as the top of the keyboard.One thing I""m not wild about is that it does not have a built-in USB port.  Instead there is an adapter that you can plug into a USB-C port -- but I'm quite sure that will quickly get lost... The reason this is an issue is if you have a trackball or other peripheral that still uses a standard USB-A dongle, well, you'll have something sticking out a couple of inches.In terms of being able to hook up to external displays -- once again, I am not seeing any display ports -- so if you are going to need some sort of docking station and those can cost a couple of hundred bucks -- on top of a laptop that you are already spending over 2K on it.So as a standalone machine -- this great.  However, to use this in desktop mode -- you'll have to spend more money and lose some of the slim cool form factor that Dell has tried so hard to maintain.[LCVR]"
B084R4T4WD,BurazeKun,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazingly thin, amazingly powerful, ok touch screen.","Reviewed in the United States on July 19, 2020","First thing that I thought about when I got this, was how durable it would be. Often with thickness comes strength, and thin equates to weaker. That would have been the case if they used traditional materials for this, instead, it is made from aluminum, well the bottom. They were able to get this unit as thin as they did using lots of aluminum and the glass for the screen. When closed, there is almost no flex, you really have to apply pressure to get some flex in it. The screen alone has some flex, this is fin but it is still more sturdy than most laptops I have laid my hands on, and as a tech who repaired them and worked with many different brands, I can say most are super flimsy. In this case, it is not flimsy at all, and it is true that most computers I worked on were cheap, but not all. Overall, they were able to get it this thin because of a good engineering.If I had to say there was any downfalls of this unit, it would have to be that it only has two ""USB -C / Thunderbolt 3 ports."" It also has a sd card reader, but so does the station I have to make up for this lack of ports. Realistically, this downfall of only two ports is defeated when you use a docking station. I am able to add 8 usb ports using the station as well as ethernet, a hdmi to monitor, as well as audio in/out. The other issue is that, with testing, the USB C / Thunderbolt charger isn't able to fuel this computer to it's fullest, it's only  afew watt drop, but while on the dock station, I get a full 45 watts to the computer, and I see improvements in the processor boost speeds as a result. While the Dell unit is rated for 45 watts, and it should be able to do more, I am not sure why, but the computer only asks for around 40 on that unit. That 5 watt difference was the difference between seeing 2.43ghz to seeing boost speeds up to 3.4ghz. When it came down to actual performance I felt though, I didn't notice any difference. Good news though, you can charge this unit from either side and this is extremely convenient. When using a dock station like mine, you can charge and use that usb port for more.Performance wise, this Dell XPS is pretty good. It uses a Kioxia SSD for the 2TB that see seq speeds of 3094MB/s read and 2826MB/s write. Random speeds still fare well here, with 2041MB/s and 1724MB/s which is more indicative to what you would see in real life application. Other versions of this laptop that I saw reviewed had Intel based SSD's that did not perform as well, but still very good. Kioxia makes their own nand chips as well, formerly being called Toshiba. The ram that is permanently installed to the motherboard on this, is 32GB at 3733MHz. This is really good when paired with the processor on board. The Intel Iris graphics unit is a huge leap for them, though probably nothing like the upcoming graphics options, but it substantially improves the performance of graphics verse previous generations, with 64 compute units verse the 48 of the last gen. You can play games on this laptop, but it is really not the best thing as many of the games will still need to be scaled back in the resolution and graphics settings likely have to be put on low, but it does open up other options. Either way, interacting with the unit is a very fast experience when it comes to using applications or web browsing. I have taken up doing CAD and some of the scripting for games my son is making. I am personally learning along side him to make games.The display on this Dell XPS is really amazing. Color accuracy is great, and colors are properly saturated, maybe a bit blooming though which offers some wow factors when watching shows. This is likely due to the HDR that this is compatible with. With a screen that has 500 nits brightness and a 10bit display, I think this is qualified as a HDR 500 from the Vesa certification for HDR. It seems to have some form of Adaptive Contrast enabled, which I am not sure how to disable. Based on the content you are looking at, the screen will look darker or lighter. The change is pretty sudden but not immediate to what you are viewing.  It also seems that the monitors brightness will adjust to the light levels of a room, this is only made apparent based on when I used it before using it again. When I would use it in the middle of the day, it would be brighter. I would stop, and turn it on later in the evening when it was dark, and the light would darken, but with a delay that would alert me to what it was before suddenly changing to the darker mode. The screen is one amazing display though and the HDR experience with this monitor has been great so far. One of the best, outside of the screen, performance, as well as sturdy case, would be keyboard feel. The keyboard on this is no mechanical keyboard, and I honestly wouldn't be able to type as well on it compared to my aqua switches, but it feels better giving me clear indication when a button is pressed, offering a firm resistence that doesn't tire my fingers out on prolonged runs. All the keys are stable, with no wobble to them and offer a amazingly well spaced layout that takes the entire width of the base, with maybe 1/4 an inch boarder on the outsides. The mouse on this works well, with clear clicks and smooth opperation due to the amazing texture and material they used for the suface. There is some discoloration when used though on that touch pad, but it is minor and normal for smooth surfaces verse the oil that keeps our skin healthy. I am sure that the white version of this wouldn't show as this is more of a black plastic problem, but the black plastic looks so good with the carbon fiber design making it hard to pass it up.Just as a notification, as I was hoping it was one, this is not a active touch screen, but instead capacitive. Works great with your fingers, but not with stylus pens or active ones. I could use the back on one of my capacitive pens meant for tablets though. So this screen will not be good for drawing on, this means I have to do my cad as a hybrid option between a drawing tablet and touch interface. I looked into it, and found that the Dell XPS 13 2in1 does have a active touch option that works with the type of pen I brought up though. This was a bit of a letdown that could have been made better by investigation the type of touch screen it was before I got the active pen.To summarize, this is one amazing laptop, Dell really did a lot of engineering on this one and it shows. It is amazingly sturdy, the display is gorgeous, the performance is above my needs, and it has been a pleasure to use for me. There have been zero software issues, no driver problems, and outside of the PSU not providing as much power as my down, it has been great. That Dell PSU is great though, really compact, and designed to be wrapped up unlike many others I have seen. It does a great job and I wouldn't have noticed much if it wasn't for a USB wattage meter that I plugged in. I would have been scratching my head trying o figure out why I saw higher boost clocks for the cpu on the station verse when on the normal charger. Boost clocks are not sustainable and not something that I saw any benefit for in the long term stress test as both showed the same draw and speed when stressed out. The boost does help with small programs loading a bit quicker, and I couldn't tell you the difference in time as they didn't seem to be much different from my perspective. With that rant out of the way, this Dell XPS 9300  has been a joy to work with. Great job Dell. Seriously, I was trying to find faults, and I was left defeated here."
B084R4T4WD,Tech User,2.0 out of 5 stars,poor thermal design,"Reviewed in the United States on July 14, 2020","good laptop when it comes to specs, design and software. Problem is that the fans run all the time and there are no controls to prevent this. Dell has removed the windows power plan control settings that influence CPU load and fan control in their own app, which can be configured to ""quite mode"" but fans are still running all the time."
B084R4T4WD,Scientist,5.0 out of 5 stars,TLDR; Gorgeous display,"Reviewed in the United States on October 15, 2020","“Dell XPS 15 9500 15.6 inch UHD+ Touchscreen Laptop (Silver) Intel Core i7-10750H 10th Gen, 16GB DDR4 RAM, 1TB SSD, Nvidia GTX 1650 Ti with 4GB GDDR6, Window 10 Pro (XPS9500-7845SLV-PUS)” is a gorgeous laptop.SummaryWhat I liked:- Gorgeous display- Highly configurable BIOS- Sturdy aluminum body- Included mini USB-C hub- Windows 10 Pro, not HomeWhat can be improved:- Average-quality keyboard- Average-quality speakersDisplay - size and aspect ratioDisplay is the best part of this laptop. It’s UHD+ and has 3840x2400 pixels. A normal UHD (4K) display has 3840x2160 pixels, so this display has 240 more pixels vertically, hence UHD”+”.  As a result, the aspect ratio is 16:10 instead of normal UHD display’s 16:9. I really like the extra vertical space, because it helps viewing long web pages and reading long emails. It is especially helpful for a small displays like this 15.6 inch display. I also like the fast that this display is edge-to-edge. It looks so modern and sleek.Display - colorsThis display has excellent color gamut of 100% Adobe RGB and 94% DCI-P3 This is much, much, wider than normal laptop displays’ color gamut which barely covers sRGB which is only 70% of Adobe RGB. The wider gamut means richer and deeper colors. It’s also worth mentioning that this laptop’s display was calibrated very well out of box. For other two laptops I bought this year, I had to use calibrator to create a custom ICC profile for them to get correct colors. I did that too with this laptop, but it didn’t make any noticeable difference.Display - contrast ratio and brightnessThis display’s contrast ratio is 1650:1 which is not as high as high-end external monitors but still decent for a laptop. Higher contrast ratio results in darker, richer black. The maximum brightness of this display 500 nits, which is very, very bright. It almost hurt my eyes at the brightest setting. Bright display really helps when you are working outside.BIOSYou can use the standard “pressing F2 key during boot up” method to enter the BIOS. This is one of the most advanced PC BIOS’es I have ever seen. It’s so highly configurable (see photos). You can use a mouse for navigation, too. If you are like me and keep this laptop on the AC adapter regularly, go to Power settings and choose “Primarily AC Use” or “Custom” (see photo). This prevents the battery to be fully charged when on AC adapter, as keeping a lithium battery at 100% State of Charge for a long period of time is bad for its longevity. I personally use Custom setting with start charging at 50% and stop charging at 60%.KeyboardKeyboard is the least exciting part of this laptop to me. It’s not bad, but compared to other high-end laptop keyboards like Thinkpad’s and Macbook Pro’s, it feels average. You can tell the difference when you press hard on keys in the middle, like “G” and “H”. The keyboard caves in a bit. This makes a huge difference when you type for hours. It’s sad that manufactures tend to pay little attention to keyboards, because they don’t have marketing appeals like number of pixels or CPU speed. Keytouch is on the soft side.SpeakerSpeakers of this laptop is also average. It’s loud, but the sound (especially the bass) becomes less and less clear as you turn up the volume. I feel vibration on the keyboard, track pad, and palm rests, too. It’s perfectly fine for zoom meeting or watching non music YouTube videos, though.Webcam and fingerprint sensorDon’t expect too much from the webcam of this laptop. It’s only HD (1280x720 pixels) resolution and takes videos at 30 fps. The lens is smaller than a grain or rice thanks to edge-to-edge display. Fingerprint sensor works very fast and reliably. This webcam supports Windows Hello login, so you can configure it to do face recognition login instead of fingerprint login.Fan noiseThis is a high-power i7 laptop, so it makes a fair amount of noise when CPU is running at its full speed. Probably, you don’t want to use this laptop as a desktop replacement in a quiet home or office.SoftwareThis laptop comes with Windows 10 Pro, as opposed to Home, so you can join a corporate Active Directory domain, use bitlocker to secure storage, create and run Hyper-V virtual machines, and become a Remote Desktop server.I like that this laptop doesn’t come with much bloatware, except for McAfee anti-virus software. It sends out tons of desktop notifications, so I usually uninstall it right away. Even uninstalling it wasn’t straightforward, because it was divided into several applications, and some of them had to be uninstalled first before uninstalling others.AccessoriesThis laptop comes with a mini USB-C hub that features a standard-size HDMI port and a USB-A port (see photos). This laptop doesn’t have any USB-A port, so this is a nice bonus. It also comes with a 130 W USB-C AC adapter. It’s smaller than a bank note and light weight (see photo)."
B084R4T4WD,czaky,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Heavy, thick, bad touchpad, sharp edges.","Reviewed in the United States on November 12, 2020","This is not a portable machine. I would categorize it as a movable workstation.It is heavy and thick. The pictures do not represent how thick this machine is because it is a wedge.For the ""aesthetics"" of a wedge they removed a lot of space for a battery and stuff.Also, the wedge has a lot of sharp edges around.If you plan to carry it around, invest into shoes with steel plate protection for toes.It may be handy in fighting off any competition at the office, as I suppose this featureswas designed for instant decapitation.For the thickness, they could have put 20 USB Type-A ports all around this laptop in 2 layers.But there is none. Turns out, the whole world still needs Type-A.The point of USB-C was to make the machines thin, so what gives?There is an intake at the bottom, which requires a straight, hard surface to drop this chunk onto.No hugging it in bed or on the beach. It is to uncomfortable anyway.The touchpad feels like cheep crap. Clicks randomly, wobbles, does not respond,comes in touch with everything due to its size, etc... worst experience ever.There is a big gap between it and the housing, which makes you wonders whatwill jump out of it.The power brick is relatively small but has a thick and cumbersome AC cable.Also the cable requires a ground support, which is ridiculous as USB-C poweradapters made to specs do not require grounding. Something odd here.As for the software.... its Windows 10 Spy-Bloat-Ware. No need to comment that.[Setup takes hours and you need to plug a cord into your brain and upload your consciousness to the mothership.]"

B084R4T4WD,Melrel05,4.0 out of 5 stars,Still has touchpad wobble even after supposed fix,"Reviewed in the United States on August 3, 2020","So I got this laptop for both me and my son. My son knows all the ins and outs of laptops and all the computer lingo. Me? Not so much. I know enough to use it for watching movies, email, the occasional writing I do, and web surfing. So basically I use it for basic tasks so that is what I’m going to base my review around.This laptop is almost 5 pounds but it’s feels really solid. The keyboard is a little more clicky than my old Mac laptop but I don’t mind it. I was really excited about it being touch screen as I’m not a huge fan of touch pads, mostly because I grew up using a mouse so that’s what I’m used to. While I really love the option of touchscreen and use it a decent amount, the fingerprints on the screen are terrible looking on this.  The touchscreen definitely needs a screen protector that’s anti fingerprint and anti glare. However I’m having a really hard time finding any kind of accessories for this as it’s so new. Which I knew would be a problem for a a month or so when I got it. Everything is very easy to find and do on here. Even for someone whom has had a MacBook for years it’s pretty self explanatory. And anything I can’t figure out I use utube to find. Haha.The only issue I have has that my son pointed out there’s a known issue with the touchpad and ours definitely has it as you can see in the video. What is troubling about this is that the box that it came in had multiple shipping labels and it looks like this was shipped to amazon, shipped back to dell, presumably to fix this issue, then sent back to amazon then to me. And it’s still really bad. I personally don’t use the touchpad enough to bother getting it fixed and my son said he isn’t that worried about it. But i know I would be very annoyed if I paid over $2,000 for a laptop and it still has this issue even after getting sent back to be fixed."
B084R4T4WD,Anthony Melton,4.0 out of 5 stars,Not for Games but Good for Everything Else,"Reviewed in the United States on July 12, 2020","This laptop has the latest Intel CPU, plenty of memory, lots of super fast storage, and even the “Pro” edition of Widows 10 (which rarely comes with a new PC).  The only thing missing is a dedicated graphics system needed for serious gaming and heavy graphics work.  However, most who used a PC for games or heavy graphics usually opt for a desktop or a faming laptop with a bigger and more expensive screen with fast refresh rates.  I see this PC as a good option for those who like the portability of a tablet but also want the power of a laptop.  I also own several tablets and a Surface laptop which is very similar to this PC.  So far I have found this laptop to be better of the two.  The power of the 10th generation i7 processor is very evident and it boots up super fast as soon as you raise the screen.  The keyboard is nice with responsive keys and touchpad.  It does get warm after prolonged use but never really very hot like my Surface does.  The battery life appears to be very good so far and is better than any of my other dozen or so laptops.  It is thin but it is heavier than I expected.  I do recommend this little powerhouse as long as you are not intending to use it for heavy gaming or graphics.  It is good enough however for Adobe CS.  I would also recommend a good case to protect it from damage."

You could tuck this in your messenger bag and still have room for textbooks, notebooks, etc. It is, by all means, a true space-saver.The convertible option is amazing. When I'm done grading papers, I can fold this in the opposite direction, prop it on my desk (or bed) and watch Netflix.  Likewise, I have used this same configuration while cooking. It made it much easier to follow tutorials. Love it! You can also convert it into a tablet configuration.The color is rich, the sound is big and full, and the brightness is impressive.The keys are backlit but ""sleep"" after a period of disuse (you can also dim them as well as entirely turn them off). They are shallow but have a clear actuation point. Likewise, the touch-pad is sensitive, but not too sensitive.This is absolutely perfect for regular use (work, watching videos, shopping, etc.) and for very light gaming.I really love the portability and versatility of this laptop! Phenomenal for students, teachers, and anyone just seeking a laptop for everyday use.Highly recommended!"
B084R4T4WD,Samantha,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great specs, fast and powerful.","Reviewed in the United States on September 13, 2020","Best laptop I’ve used in the last few years. I want to preface by saying I’m a Mac fan, I purchased my first MacBook Air in 2013 and never had any reason to return to a Windows device (the Dell XPS was for my husband originally but I absolutely loved it so it’s now my main device). The form factor is so slim, it’s lightweight and ultra portable with a great battery life. The screen is beautiful with thin bezels and the option to use as a tablet too. It you just need something for school/streaming or something with more power for video/photo editing the specs on this device are powerful enough for most tasks.A Few Negatives -The fingerprint sensor isn’t great, if often fails and I’m required to enter my pin.I’m really missing USB ports and having to carry a dongle around just in case I need it is a little annoying."

Stuff to know (from our observations so far):-This is a thin (0.57” thick at its thickest) beautiful little machine.-There’s a Micro SD card slot, which is great!  It’s a spring-assisted mechanism used to remove the card.  It sits really flush otherwise.  I’d rather it go into the machine more, just to keep it from ejecting when carrying around.  That being said, it doesn’t just fall out.  I’m in IT, so I’m on the go in the field.  I want to make sure my stuff is secure.-The carbon fiber interior is SEXY.  It’s smooth and tactile.  You WANT to have your hands on it.-You only get 2 USB-C ports.  The mercy there is that they are both Thunderbolt 3 (verified using a Thunderbolt 3 drive with it).  This means it’s stupid fast.  It’s just a higher class of port.-There is a phenomena concerning disappearing ports on laptops.  I miss copious amounts of jacks.  This comes with a USB-C to USB-A adapter, which is nice to have.  You will need it.-The bezel is really slight, as well as the camera.  It’s but a wee dot. You won’t be able to use the standard camera covers on this.  Paranoid people beware.-I like chunky keys on my keyboard, and these are more Chiclet-y.  That’s a personal preference thing.  I know you can turn this thing into a tablet, so that was likely a design factor.  But y’all, I would be SO uncomfortable sitting this thing on the keys.  To me, that’s sacrilege. I’d have to use the old tent formation to go with the tablet look.  When you do bend the hinges, it asks you if you want to convert to tablet mode.-The screen feels good.  It’s BRIGHT and very responsive.  The speakers are impressive for their size.  It’s loud, but lacks the more bass notes if you’re doing music. But nature documentaries?  The colors and sounds are perfect.-This is expensive but I’ve always understood that this is basically the best 13” 2 in 1 laptops.  If you want that kind of performance (and you’re NOT a gamer), this is a thing of beauty.Since the COVID, laptops are rather hard to come by.  My mom needs something to do some work on, so she’s going to be using it at least for a little while.  I think the versatility  of the design will be perfect for her.  Then, it comes back to us where it belongs!!"
B084R4T4WD,DisneyDenizen,4.0 out of 5 stars,COMES WITH VIDEO EDITING SOFTWARE PRE-INSTALLED,"Reviewed in the United States on August 8, 2020","EDIT: This laptop is so prone to overheating that it has to be shut off at night. Otherwise the fan kicks in so loudly that it wakes my daughter up!I got this laptop for my daughter, who was long overdue for a new one. She primarily uses a computer to watch Netflix, make YouTube videos, and do the usual things like Facebook and email. Her previous laptop was a monstrously huge “laptop” that was designed to sit on a desk, so her first observation was that the screen is smaller. But of course her new laptop is superior in nearly every other way. Here are her observations some of which were in response to my pointed questions based on other reviewers' experiences:I do not like the track pad. It's annoying, and it doesn't always work right. It's too big. It does not have a wobble, but there's no way to right click. Maybe that's not going to be a problem once I get used to it; maybe it's just the way of the world now.The video editing software works. It's good for being on a laptop. The video editing software came pre-installed. And it's not the crappy one that no likes. It's the one I'm used to.I can tell that the graphics are excellent. The sound quality is excellent.The box was not banged up. The laptop was not banged up. The box was really sturdy. The laptop appears to be brand new.Came with free virus protection.No disk drive, but those are a thing of the past, anyway.No USB drive, but there's an adaptor with it.* * *I saw my daughter's face the moment she figured out, “This is a touchscreen!!” She was so excited.It is also worth noting that she set this laptop up by herself straight out of the box.When we chatted using the Dell's webcam to test it, the colors and lighting seemed to be off to me. Everything looked a bit pale compared to FaceTime. Perhaps she just needs to fiddle with the settings."

It really gives the Macbook Air a run for its money.  And it brings the power with the i7.  I'm not 100% sure if an i5 wouldn't have been enough in here: I don't think I'm about to use this for gaming (which cares more about GPU than CPU anway), but my wife wants to try photoshop on it to see if the touchscreen makes photo editing any different.  The screen is small, but because it's borderless, it's really not that much smaller than my 15-inch laptop's screen.  The keyboard is a bit cramped, and there's no way I would be able to type as quickly.  At home, a dock and an external mechanical keyboard would be a must.If I ever go back to making sales calls at customer's offices, this will make a very nice impression.  The only downside is that it is so small and thin that I am absolutely TERRIFIED of breaking it.Also, while Dell *used* to include a lot of bloatware, this appears to be stock win10 and performs exactly as you would hope.That said the one thing that blew me away is the sound.  Using this for a zoom call or watching a movie is amazing, and a feature that I really really really didn't expect.  The speakers are on the bottom of the laptop, and it uses this to create what is basically crystal clear surround sound.  I'm so blown away by it that there's no question this gets five stars."

I found that with regular office work use starting with a full charge, I needed to recharge it midday.  I haven't had issues with loud fans, but it also does run hot after a couple hours of use, but so far that hasn't caused it to shut down without warning from overheating.The total weight is somewhat heavy for my taste, but it also feels tank-like and durable.The screen is gorgeous, and it's easily my favorite part of the laptop, and the touchscreen is accurate and responsive.The touchpad is probably my least favorite part of the laptop.  It's functional and I don't think it's defective like some other reviewers have reported for theirs, but it's not the most comfortable to use. Luckily I usually lean harder on my favorite mouse or the touchscreen, so I just avoid using it.I'm also not into Dell's keyboards.  The buttons aren't squishy but they're a little hard.  More irritating is how this keyboard doesn't have dedicated PgDn or PgUp keys and you have to use Function + the Up or Down arrows.  I've made myself adapt to the loss, but normal PgUp and PgDn keys are available on laptops with smaller screens/dimensions, so this is not my prefernce.I haven't any trouble with the speakers so far. The headphone jack is a little rigid you do need to make sure the cord end snaps into place.  Same with the webcam; it didn't wow me but it was fine.  But if a cutting edge webcam is important to you, this probably isn't it.  Note that the bezel is super narrow so if you need to cover the lens for security reasons, you're going to need a teeny tiny sticker to cover it without obscuring part of the top of the screen.It has no old-style USB Type-A ports on the body of the laptop, just the three USB-C ports, but that's becoming more and more par for the course with newer laptops and Chromebooks.  And it comes with a free mini hub, which has an HDMI and USB-A port if you need those.It comes with an average amount of bloatware, and even though I got this computer right around the release date, you'll likely need to deal with the simple yet tedious process of installing Dell firmware updates and Windows security updates before the computer is completely ready to use.  It comes with Windows 10 and there are preinstalled Start Menu links to try Office 365 for a few days but of course it needs to be purchased separately."
B084R4T4WD,MyPenName,4.0 out of 5 stars,cinder block,"Reviewed in the United States on July 31, 2020","This is a glorious laptop. The downfall is that it comes at the cost of a lot of weight. This thing is heavy. Exceptionally heavy for a laptop. Even the thick laptops from decades ago were not this heavy. You can use this thing to tone your biceps. Definitely not something lightweight and portable for travel. Keep that in mind if you want something lightweight. If the weight isnt an issue, it is a superb laptop.Specs speak for themselves. This can handle anything you want or need to do, all at once, too.Build quality is impeccable.Screen is the best ive seen. Stunning, especially for a laptop. Crystal clear and gorgeous. Glare isnt as bad as I expected with the type of screen , but there is definitely glare. Not as bad as some other glossy screens that I have had over the years though.Touchscreen is immediately responsive and was perfectly calibrated. Trackpad is probably the best I have ever experienced and I have/have had so many laptops over the years. I love the large area and how smooth it feels. It is very accurate and responsive. No wobbling. Soft click.Keyboard is nice to type on fluidly. Very quiet. Keys are low - they do not protrude much. You dont experience skipping keys or anything like that.Nice rubberized matte finish on the trim surrounding keyboard and trackpad. Very smooth, but not slippery soft feel.You can plug the charger in on either side to charge the laptop, which is a nice convenience.It is one heck of a machine and very nice to use. Everything about it just feels good in regards to typing, using trackpad, etc. No complaints with actual use of it at all. It is super fast, efficient, and a solid workhorse, as well as great for entertainment purposes like watching movies or videos or certain gaming. It feels durable and sturdy with the aluminum build. Screen doesnt feel too thin or fragile.Aside from the weight, the only thing I can find to gripe about is the heat. The bottom gets hot almost immediately. I am not sure if that is typical due to the specs and it should expected, or if it is something I should worry about. The little raised areas on the bottom to allow the heat to escape when resting on a flat surface are not enough. Needs to be up on a riser or stand to allow more air flow. Other than that, it is a glorious beast."
B084R4T4WD,Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing build. An incremental step forward with an already amazing PC / laptop,"Reviewed in the United States on August 23, 2020","The XPS 15 models have been the top of the line for Dell for a few years. This year seems like no exception and Dell has gone one step further with the amazing high resolution screen (higher than 4k!?) and the great build quality that is s step up from previous years.I was happy to see that they went away from OLED screens even though I really like them overall, they really don't work that well for lighter gaming or for color accurate work. They can be very good, so don't get me wrong here, I love OLED's, I just think they have more tradeoffs than you want for a laptop / work machine.This machine and its high specs are nearly perfect. I did upgrade to 32gb of ram and my understanding is that it can take up to 64 gb. (maybe 128?)The bottom panel is a little harder to remove than previous years, but not hard. Look for some dell based videos or a youtube video showing you how before you jump in.I was also very pleased to see a second NVME slot , but disappointed that it didn't come with the heatsink that the stock drive comes with. I guess you will either need to apply your own heatsink material or order another one from Dell. At this price point, those details should be included (IMHO).The machine has all the needed accessories including a full sized SD Card slot.All in all, the fit and finish on the new 15 inch Dell XPS is amazing and the updated / refreshed look is all positive while maintaining a winning form factor / build quality / design of the previous versions.If you are in the market for the best PC / Laptop you can buy, this is one for your comparison list."
B084R4T4WD,JLES,5.0 out of 5 stars,This laptop is nearly perfect.,"Reviewed in the United States on August 15, 2020","I haven't been a fan of Dell computers in the past.  In my experience they come bloated with extra software that can't be removed and are almost impossible to work on.  This is the first one that I have owned in a long time and I was pleasantly surprised.  The only bloatware that comes on it is Dells phone app that is a replica of the one built in to the OS and their support app.  Both can be removed if you choose.  Normally I would do a clean Windows install to get rid of all of the crap but I didn't have to this time.I read a lot of reviews that the touchscreen wasn't responsive but I haven't experienced any problems with it.  I think that might have been fixed in a software update.  The combination of Intel's 10th gen I-7 processor, 16gb of  DD4 ram and M.2 NVME SSD makes this laptop blazing fast.  The ram can be upgraded to 32gb and it has two free M.2 slots available.  It comes with a 1tb M.2 PCI-E SSD and the other two free slots are easily accessed to be able to add more.  Most laptops these days come with integrated graphics cards but this one has a dedicated Nvidia GTX 1650 TI.  I'm not a heavy gamer so I'm not sure how it would perform with graphics intensive games but I think would hold its own.  I've thrown multitasking with several excel sheets on different monitors and some light gaming on it and haven't had any lag at all.I would rate the battery life as average.  Depending on how I use it and the screen brightness I can get about 6-8 hours on a charge.  The good thing is that it doesn't take long at all to charge back up.  30 minutes of charging will net you another 3-4 hours.My only gripe about this laptop is the fingerprint sensor.  It is built in with the power button and I often have to try multiple times to get it to read or end up putting my pin in.  I would have like it better if they would have had a separate for the sensor.  With that said though I absolutely love it.  It is leaps and bounds above the Gen 2 Surface pro laptop that I was using."

Dell has really made a fantastic blend of form & function with this XPS 9300 touchscreen UHD 13.4 in. Laptop.... it truly shines.Set up is a 10 minute breeze.... less if you like to run in ""stealth"" mode without all the bells n whistles.Stability is a wonderful thing, and this laptop could not trip over itself if you tied it's Ram to it's Rom while running backwards.  ?  makes no sense but you get the picture, this laptop is a smooth running glitch free machine.And it is a cool running machine, well ventilated with 2 fans, & the all aluminum case helps a bit as well... it always feels cool to the touch.Build Quality - nothing less than awesome, the engineering that went this is amazing.... you can really feel the quality when you touch this laptop.... it makes you think, Wow! this is nice :)Sound - is about the best I have heard in a laptop.... loud enough to hear clearly even with a fan on high nearby...Speaking of sound, when i the last time you heard this?Dude... I got a Dell!  sorry, always wanted to say that :) remember the Dell commercial guy?Anywho -As many have pointed out... this is not a laptop designed to game with, it is a work/business machine... that IS good for some entertainment via streaming movies, YouTube ""edutainment"" ect ect. as the video quality is excellent.I love the touchscreen feature, it just comes in handy sometimes ..... and Dells touchscreen functions flawlessly.And going from a closed/cold start to open/up n running is faster than ever with the one touch power/start button.So thin.... will fit easily into laptop carry bags n backpacks.IMO this is THE Best Laptop in the lightweight/business class category.... it just has it all & then some...Dell scores a big win win with this one....5 Stars + Quality Product RecommendationDude - you need to get a Dell :)"

B084R4T4WD,A Mom with Kids and Fur Kids,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good Computer for Work-At-Home,"Reviewed in the United States on August 13, 2020","This DELL features 16 gigs of ram and a 512 gig of SSD.  Like the new Macs it doesn’t have ports that can be used without an adapter.  Personally I'm annoyed by that, but it’s the industry standard.The XPS 13 would be a good work computer.  It comes with Windows Pro which is a definite upgrade to what you get with most PCs.  The screen is nice with very little border.  That said, it's doesn't compare to the clarity of Apple laptops.  By which I mean the pixel density is not the same.  But certainly good for work-from-home.The XPS 13 is also not a gamer computer.  The graphics are good enough for most purposes but not intense gaming requirements.  I streamed videos and movies and it performs.ODDLY enough I found the laptop a little difficult to open because there is no ‘pocket’ to slip your finger into.  Also, I should tell you that the speakers are set up for streaming/bluetooth to other devices.  Which is to say that the in-house speakers are initially disabled and looking for external output.The most serious problem I ran across was overheating.  This slim and stylish laptop is not one you can use on your lap and I highly recommend that you get a cooling unit for it.  Mine overheated on a shelf and we had an H of a time getting it to turn off so it could cool down.  Lesson lerned.Overall a very good unit for work-at-home.  Set up was even easier than our last Dell."
B084R4T4WD,tz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Solid Laptop,"Reviewed in the United States on July 16, 2020","I waffled between giving this a 4 star or 5 star review. In the end, it's really in between but since there isn't an option for a 4.5 star I rounded up to be fair. I'm not a huge tech person but I have used several computers over the years and know what I like and this laptop is a solid computer with a touchscreen option that makes it more desirable for me to travel with than a tablet.PROS:--Beautiful design and color: The Platinum silver looks sleek.--Lightweight: The size and weight make this ultraportable. It's a tad bigger than a tablet--Full keyboard for easy typing--The 16:10 display is awesome--Great webcam--Able to set up for facial recognition, fingerprint, or password--Good amount of storage--Decent battery power--Great screen touchpad - I love having this option. It's like having a tablet but with the functionality of a laptop--Easy set upCons:--Price - Buyers pay a premium for the added features--Limited Ports - I can't plug my flash drives into this and have to buy a separate USB-C port to flash drive or buy the special flash drive--Gets hot after several hours on lapOverall, I'm excited about the portability of this laptop and it will replace what I have as my go to laptop for travel. Plus, I love having the touch screen which makes a lot of things faster for me than using a mouse."
B084R4T4WD,Amy S.,5.0 out of 5 stars,My Favorite Laptop Ever!,"Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2020","Let me start by saying that I'm travelling right now. With me, I have this laptop, along with my work laptop, a 2020 16"" Macbook Pro, and an iPad Pro with Magic Keyboard. Not once I have reached for the Macbook. I absolutely love the form factor of this 13"" Dell. It's tiny, but the screen and keyboard are magnificent! The screen has rich, gorgeous colors that radiate across a near-bezel-free presentation. The Gorilla Glass touch screen is incredibly useful when consuming content, like the newspaper. In addition, the keyboard is comfortable and full-sized, despite this laptop's tight little package.In addition to the form factor, the laptop is speedy and comes with loads of storage and RAM. I regularly edit photos is Lightroom and it's working perfectly. I often have dozen windows open, including Lightroom, a Figma design document (I'm a UX designer) with heavy graphical elements, and Pandora or YouTube TV running in the background. This little laptop supports it all. In fact, it's hard to find ANYTHING bad to say about it. But I'll stretch a bit and say that it can get a little hot. That said, even at it's hottest, it's still quiet.If you're looking for a great laptop that incredibly portable and lightweight, look no further. I'm truly in love with this gem!!"

I'm a content creator, so I spend hours in word, powerpoint, publisher, etc. Through it all, this laptop has been a dream.I love the USBC/thunderbolt ports, it's very modern. If you do still use standard USB devices though, it does come with a dongle to make that possible. Very thoughtful.I was further impressed by the look and feel of the machine.It feels sleek, yet durable, and it looks the same. When you pull this out of a bag or briefcase, you're going to look truly classy. This is a machine that looks as good as it is, and truly is worth every penny.Good job on this one, Del!"
B084R4T4WD,TMStyles,5.0 out of 5 stars,Impressive Laptop,"Reviewed in the United States on July 2, 2020","The new ""Dell New XPS 13 9300 13.4-inch UHD InfinityEdge Touchscreen Laptop"" is a very impressive looking and performing small laptop--at least so far.  It is a beautifully designed silver laptop with a 16:10 4 sided infinity edge display meaning there is virtually no border space wasted.  It is UHD  with 3840 X 2400 pixels making the display crystal clear.It comes with all the latest bells and whistles including touchscreen, webcam, Corning Gorilla Glass 6 screen, and dual cooling fans.  The actual construction of this super thin laptop is breath catching for some--supposedly cut from solid aluminum to fit perfectly together.  It has no optical drive and uses USB-c ports.The unit is powered by a 10th generation Intel core i7 chip, contains 32g on board Ram and 2TB in storage.  So far I have found it to be quick and easy to power up and very responsive with its Windows 10 Home OS.  I am not a gamer so I have no comment on the reviews cautioning against using it for gaming purposes.  I have had very mixed results with Dell units in the past, but if this holds up, it will be a welcome addition to my acquisitions.  It is a sleek, well constructed, high def machine that I recommend after only a week of using."
B084R4T4WD,Strucc,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Respectable processing, but for this amt of $, buy something else","Reviewed in the United States on November 20, 2020","First the good...Great keyboard, thin, respectable graphics, love that it's a high res touchscreen.Then the shortcomings...- Yes, I know it's flagship, and thin, but still would like to have had at least one USB-A connector.- Doesn't take smaller chargers. I have a super small 30W charger I like to travel with. My MBP will not complain and during use, will not drain as fast if connected and take its time charging when not being used. The Dell XPS will just say ""no"".- gets hotter than I would like and fans not as quiet as what I would expect from a flagship laptop (expert opinion).- I'm trying to think of a product I have in my house with a camera that is worse than this one... and for the life of me, I can't come up with one. This includes an old Samsung phone, a generic Chinese tablet, and a 6 year old, base model, sub $400 Lenovo Flex 3 I bought on sale. I just can't believe it's this bad. I just assumed that a flagship laptop purchase would have an impressive camera and had I known it was this bad, I would definitely have bought something else. Unfortunately in today's world and because of the apps we use, camera quality is now a top priority on laptops and pushes this laptop to the bottom of any consideration list. The Dell XPS15 9500 (2020) camera plain sucks. Light, bright light, low-light: the only safe-for-work adjective I have for it is: sucks. The camera ruins it for the whole laptop. Assume you don't have one. I have yet to try the reinstall driver recommendation I read on Dell's website post, but I'll try that... I regret not doing my usual research and due diligence in comparing products and reading reviews before making this (very expensive) purchase. :("
B084R4T4WD,J. Silva,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great laptop!,"Reviewed in the United States on July 5, 2020","This laptop is a great product. First thing you will notice is how compact it is. It fits well in any carrier you would have and leaves tons of room to spare. It weighs about 7 lbs, so it is very easy to carry and have it fit in an environment like a desk or at the side of the bed. Even with its size it is still a strong computer. With 1.5 GHz, it can run basic documents, email, browsers, files, and anything else you would need for business really well. Plus the 36 GB of storage allows for a lot of information to be saved and brought with you, if you are on the move. Another point in its favor and what makes it a great laptop is battery life. On average, you get around 6 hours of active use before it dies. You can also customize it, so if you need more battery or performance out of the laptop, it is available. One point I dislike is its lack of usb ports or any ports other than two USB-C ports and a headphone jack, but it does come with a USB-C converter, so you can plug other devices in. Overall, the laptop is perfect for someone who is constantly on the move and needs an efficient, reliable computer to bring with them that doesn't take up too much space, but can hold a lot of information. It also works perfectly in an office setting."
B084R4T4WD,Kindle Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,Horrible color problems,"Reviewed in the United States on November 14, 2020","They advertise this as a great computer for video and photo editing with a great screen and good colors but that can't be further from the truth. It has horrible banding issues and very pixilated when watching video and the colors are not accurate. Its partly due to the Dell Primer Color program that comes installed on the computer. With some research I found out it has been messing up the colors and causing banding issues and pixilation for over a year. Its a common problem on the Dell support site. Dell blames Intel, but the fact of the matter is that if you Uninstall the Dell program it gets a little better. They refuse to just acknowledge the problem and fix it though. If your using this for photo or video editing spend the extra $500 and buy a MacBook. This is unacceptable for a computer of this price that is advertised for creative work."

It is thin and light weight. I like that I can use it as a small laptop, or as a tablet.Both the touchscreen and the keyboard are quick to respond. I find the keyboard and touch pad to be comfortable to use. The computer loads quickly. It did come with some games and trial programs that easy to remove. Just right click on them and select uninstall. It's easy to research online to find what's not needed. Setting it up is as simple as signing into your Window's account if you have one.I am using this for every day task such as emails, recipes, social media, shopping, and streaming. For that, I am very happy with this. I love that it's lightweight and small enough to slip into my backpack. The sound and picture are great."

Nothing wrong, great specs, but not a top gaming machine.With 32gig of RAM and 2TB storage, this computer is fast with lots of storage. It is also compatible with the new WiFi standard, WiFi 6.The shell was made from a single sheet of aluminum making this fast little jewel easy on the eyes, too.

Stunning HDR display. Its very quiet and compact. It's worth mentioning that it only has the 2 USB-C ports but that's to be expected for a thin compact notebook. We have an external multiport usb hub that takes care of that problem. The speakers are fine if not great but again for a thin, compact machine that's to be expected as well. The touch screen works as expected although with the smaller screen it might give you some trouble if you have larger hands. I don't really have a need to use the touchscreen though so it's not really an issue. Battery life is decent depending on what type of activities you are doing. Start up time is quick which is no surprise with most SSD devices.It has a nice high-quality feel to it. Really a solid, fast and impressive laptop."

I use it more as tablet form then anything.The voice to text needs some work because I am having to go back and correct a whole lot more then my MacBook or iPad.Maybe in time it will learn my speaking voice.It is quick and has enough memory for me on how I’m using it.I haven’t found a lot of options as to cases so hopefully in time, there will be more options."
